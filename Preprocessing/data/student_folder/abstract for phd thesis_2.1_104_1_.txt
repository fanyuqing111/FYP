Quantum Interferences with Nanostructured Metamaterials 
By Charles Altuzarra 
 
 
 
The ability to fabricate nanostructures by using chemical and physical processes can allow 
precise tuning of a materialâ€™s optical properties.  
 
This thesis explores the interactions between quantum states of light and nanostructured 
metamaterials. The experimental investigations constitute 1) the first quantum coherent perfect 
absorption experiment, 2) the nonlocal control of coherent perfect absorption with polarization 
entangled photons and 3) the focusing of quantum states of light past the diffraction limit 
through tailored interferences of a single photon.
