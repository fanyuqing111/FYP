Good morning Prof Law 
 
You have indicated that this thesis contains confidential information, hence all examiners will be required to sign the attached Non‐Disclosure Agreement(NDA) form. 
Please confirm and be reminded that some examiners are unwilling to sign the form and we would have to get new examiners who are willing to do so. 
 
Thank you and best regards
