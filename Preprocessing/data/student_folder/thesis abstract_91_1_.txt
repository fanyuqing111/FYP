Title: Engineering Functional Nanomaterials for Biophotonics and Nanomedicine 
Applications 
 
Abstract： 
   To date, functional nanomaterials have been commonly synthesized and applied 
for various biomedical applications such as sensing, imaging, drug delivery, and 
tissue engineering due to their unique optical, electronic, and biocompatible property. 
In this PhD work, two types of nanomaterials have been engineered, characterized, 
and studied for biophotonic sensing and nanodrug delivery therapy, namely, 2D 
nanomaterials and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The engineered solutions 
presented in the thesis aims at addressing the current limitations in optical biosensors 
and self-powered skin patch drug delivery devices. In the first part of thesis, we 
studied the physical and optical property of a series two-dimensional (2D) 
nanomaterials such as molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide, and molybdenum 
diselenide, etc., to develop and optimize next generation of plasmonic biosensors with 
sensitivity as high as 100 Deg/RIU. Upon coating these 2D nanomaterials on the 
surface of gold sensing chip, the detection sensitivity was discovered to increase by at 
least 2 folds due to the high refractive index up to ~4.7. Through modeling and 
experimental studies, a 300% increment in the detection sensitivity was achieved by 
using the engineered 2D nanomaterials-based plasmonic biosensor when compared to 
traditional devices. In addition, we showed that 1-2 orders of magnitude enhancement 
could be achieved in the phase-sensing mode that supports real-time submolecular 
detection in our designed nanoplasmonic sensor.  
   In the second part of the work, we designed and studied the triboelectric 
nanogenerator (TENG) in creating a miniaturized self-powered drug delivery device 
for transdermal patch application. TENG system can effectively convert various 
mechanical energies into electricity. TENG has many advantages such as large output 
of power, low cost, simple fabrication and high conversion efficiency. Our prepared 
TENG was able to power the transdermal patch we designed. The designed 
TENG-based transdermal patch composed of a conductive and nanoporous polymer 
and the drugs embedded in the polymer matrix were released upon receiving 
electric-stimuli externally. Such mechanism can allow one to achieve precise control 
in programming the drug delivery profile by tailoring the appropriate TENG action 
time. More importantly, we showed that the TENG-based transdermal patch system 
can be effectively used to deliver the desired drug concentration to the ex vivo 
porcine skin. The drug delivery efficiency in dermis was noted to improve by at least 
50% when compared with the absence of TENG triggered reaction.  
   In conclusion, this PhD work has generated reliable and emerging engineering 
solutions to overcome challenges we faced in the current healthcare diagnostic and 
therapeutic technology especially in the areas of SPR sensors and skin patch drug 
delivery devices. Such solutions can be further integrated into other sensing and drug 
delivery systems for personalized treatment applications.
