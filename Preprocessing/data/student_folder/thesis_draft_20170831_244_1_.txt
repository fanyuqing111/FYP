Abstract 
 
Advanced Driver Assistant System (ADAS) was developed to reduce hazard on road, as 
driver were tended to get distracted from non-driving tasks. Researchers widely 
acknowledges that machine learning should be applied in ADAS, so that system can 
recognize driver’s state and adapt accordingly. Applying machine learning on physiological 
signal to learn psychological model is a common research topic. Yet, little work have 
considered of challenges in implementation, which is different from other machine learning 
domains. Usual approach is to collect many signals and go through tedious signal processing 
to output feature vectors. Machine learning plays its part only after feature is available. 
Which is costly and also unlikely to be feasible in real world situation. We propose new 
machine learning based methodology that only requires simple single signal combined with 
manifold learning algorithm. Our methodology is robust in that it requires only one signal 
but doesn’t compromise the performance. The first contribution of the work is that we 
collected data from partly automated vehicle’s simulation, which little work was done to 
apply machine learning. The second contribution is we proposed new feature extraction 
methods which only exploits ECG signal. Our methods do not require domain specific 
knowledge or tedious signal processing procedure. As long as interval between R peaks are 
available (which can be measured easily with cheap commercial equipment) our manifold 
learning based features extractor will provide reliable features. As this implies no 
preprocessing it is more beneficial for implementation.
