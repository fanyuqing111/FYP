Abstract
The greatest weakness of current circuits is thermal.
Localized temperature increase
can significantly degrade a circuit performance, sometimes irreversibly.
In this the-
sis, we investigate the potential of replacing copper interconnects in 3D architecture
with an alternative hybrid carbon structure: carbon nanotubes covalently bonded to
graphene/graphite horizontal interconnects.
The structure is highly conductive both
thermally and electrically and can sustain higher current densities than currently used
copper interconnects. We also focused our interest in studying the thermal degradation
mechanisms of such carbon-based devices. To do so, we first studied the joule-heating
induced electrical failure of graphene based devices (electro-burning). From our observa-
tions, the presence of defects greatly influences the electro-burning of graphene. To gain
more insight into this degradation, we used a femtosecond laser to locally induce thermal
damage to the graphene. Finally, we showed how electro-burning, when controlled, can
be an advantage. We use a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam to induce defects in
graphene according to selected patterns. We show that, contrary to the pristine graphene
devices where nanogap position and shape is uncontrolled, the nanogaps in pre-patterned
devices propagate along the defect line created by the femtosecond laser. Using passive
voltage contrast combined with atomic force microscopy, we confirmed the reproducibility
of the process with a 92% success rate over 26 devices.
