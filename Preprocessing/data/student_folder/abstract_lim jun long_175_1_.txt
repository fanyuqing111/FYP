Abstract 
The key challenge for new Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) sensor is to achieve high sensitivity 
while keeping fabrication process simple. For PCF-based Refractive Index (RI) sensing at 
ultralow concentrations, sufficient light-molecules interaction is necessary for high sensitivity 
detection. This dissertation describes the key research contribution to the development of high RI 
sensitivity In-Line Microbubble (ILM) PCF sensor for various sensing applications. The work 
leads to the first report of PCF modal interferometry based sensor with ILM for RI sensing; Prior 
work has focused on strain or temperature sensing. A thorough search of the relevant literature 
also yielded only the ILM PCF biosensor being the first bioaffinity report using PCF modal-
based interferometer. The dissertation also covers significant research contribution to PCF 
coupler structure with selective infiltration of nematic liquid crystal, and modeling, with 
simulation software, the micro-channel structure inside single mode fiber to find the most 
optimal structure.
