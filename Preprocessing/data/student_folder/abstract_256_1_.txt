 
Design of a one-watt level RF power amplifier for smartphones 
Abstract 
Smartphones, embodying wireless data and voice communication means, are increasingly 
the wireless communications transceiver (phone) of choice. Nevertheless, the primary 
complaint of smartphone users is the short battery lifespan between charges, and this 
complaint is exacerbated with the increasing speed and amount of data communications, 
particularly with the existing 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) data and impending 5G 
data communication protocols. 
The radio frequency power amplifier (RF PA) is one of the most critical blocks in the 
smartphone, in part because it is the most power-dissipative block therein. To address the 
said short battery lifespan, it is imperative that the power dissipation of the RF PA be low 
and its power-efficiency high. 
The objective of this MEng program is to design a fully integrated one-watt RF power 
amplifier using 65nm CMOS process. To achieve one-watt output power, the power-
combining technique is applied to combine two power cells. The linearity and efficiency 
issues related to the chip, package, printed circuit board are discussed. Further objectives 
include LTE applications and linearity and efficiency improvement for LEES-SMART 
InGaAs-on-CMOS process.
