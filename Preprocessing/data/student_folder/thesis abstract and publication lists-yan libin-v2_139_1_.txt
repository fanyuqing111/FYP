META-FLUIDIC-MATERIALS DESIGN, FABRICATION AND 
EXPERIMENT 
YAN LIBIN 
Metasurfaces are subwavelength-thick planar materials artificially designed with 
distinctive electromagnetic properties. The flexibility of tailoring both the permittivity and 
permeability of the metasurface enables its extraordinary electromagnetic response that cannot be 
find in natural materials. The extraordinary electromagnetic properties of metasurface lead to many 
promising and practical applications. This doctorate thesis focuses on the design, simulation, 
fabrication and experimental measurement of meta-fluidic-material for tailoring the optical 
properties of electromagnetic waves. Specifically, three types of meta-fluidic-material are studied 
and discussed, namely: (1) dispersion-controllable metasurface for tailoring the dispersion 
property of metasurface; (2) polarization-independent tunable metasurface for polarization-
independent beam control, and (3) Tunable birefringent metasurface for the manipulation of 
birefringence. 
The first part of this thesis demonstrates an adaptable metasurface in which the optical 
response is dynamically controlled according to the incident wavelength for specific functionality. 
The adaptable metasurface is composed of a periodic array of liquid-metal ring-shaped resonators 
whereby their geometry can be tuned individually. The adaptable metasurface is designed for 
dispersion control with applications include deflecting electromagnetic waves of different 
frequencies into the same directions or focusing them with the same focal length . 
The second part of this thesis reports a subwavelength-thick polarization-independent 
metasurface composed of reconfigurable C-shaped resonators (RCRs). The symmetry of RCRs 
bestows the scattered electromagnetic waves with equal amplitude and phase modulation under 
TM-polarized incidence and TE-polarized incidence, which empowers the metasurface with the 
feature of polarization independence. Spin-conserved retroreflection and polarization-independent 
beam steering are demonstrated by designing the metasurface with certain phase gradient to 
introduce an in-plane momentum to the incident EM wave.  
The third part of the thesis presents a tunable birefringent metasurface for manipulation of 
the birefringence of metasurface. The tunable cross resonators serve as the building blocks of the 
tunable birefringent metasurface. The two orthogonal resonance eigenmodes of the tunable cross 
resonators can be independently controlled and tuned to tailor the birefringence of the metasurface. 
The independent control and tailor of two orthogonal resonance modes is enabled by the flexibility 
of microfluidic system. Applications such as tunable beam splitting, polarization-insensitive beam 
steering and quarter waveplates are demonstrated through the manipulation of the birefringence of 
this tunable birefringent metasurface. 
In conclusion, dispersion control, polarization independence, and birefringence 
manipulation are demonstrated using meta-fluidic-material, which paves the way for promising 
applications in flat optical technologies, communication system and imaging system, to name just 
a few.
