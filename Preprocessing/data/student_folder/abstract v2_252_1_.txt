Scheduling Strategy Design for Unit Commitment with 
Energy Storage System and Solar Energy Resource 
 
Abstract 
 
 
Unit commitment, pre-setting scheduling and arrangement of the electrical generator 
operation, plays a critical role in the power system optimization problem which aims to 
utilize power resources rationally and enhance the efficiency of operational economy 
under the condition of safe operation of power system. With the high penetration of 
renewable energy, which increases deregulation when renewable energy is fed into 
the traditional power system and attention of safety operation in power system, there 
is a growing focus on optimization with uncertainty. We propose a day-ahead unit 
commitment model to minimize the impact of uncertainty. The scheduling strategy is 
composed of two main cases which correspond to the two intervals of the probability 
distribution of the solar power output. The energy storage system is dispatched to 
guarantee the power system security when the margin of error is beyond the 
confidence interval of solar power probability. Facing with both volatile load demand 
and the solar power, interval optimization is adopted to reduce the complexity of this 
optimization problem. Priority list is considered so that the energy storage system is 
flexible to maintain the power balance with an acceptable cost and maximum the 
utilization of the renewable energy.
