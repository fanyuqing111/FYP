Stability Improvement and Control Optimization of Isolated 
Two-Stage AC-DC-DC Converter Systems 
 
Abstract 
 
As the renewable integration trend continues, more and more power electronic 
converters are required as the interfaces between different networks in the power 
systems. However, the direct interaction of the converters introduces uncertainties to 
the power systems, especially for the stability and reliability. 
 
This thesis focuses on the instability issues of the dual active bridge (DAB) converter-
based two-stage DC-DC-AC systems and addresses their concerns. Specifically, the 
full-order impedance model of the DAB converter is presented for the first time to 
facilitate the stability analysis. Based on the impedance model, the effects of different 
DAB modulation schemes on the stability have been analyzed and the optimal 
modulation method is investigated from the point of view of stability. The proposed 
feedback controller optimization method is effective to improve the stability of the two-
stage system. Moreover, a family of impedance shaping regulators is proposed to 
suppress the dc-bus voltage ripples.
