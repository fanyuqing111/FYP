performance

Abstract 
 
Strong light localization within metal nanostructures occurs by collective oscillations of 
plasmons in the form of electric and magnetic resonances. The high susceptibility of such 
localized surface plasmons (LSP) to refractive index changes has made it an excellent platform 
for rapid and label-free sensing, particularly in the development of low-cost sensing platforms in 
the visible spectrum. However, the linear relationship between sensitivity and resonance 
wavelength indicates that sensitivity decreases for shorter wavelengths. In this thesis, alternative 
plasmon resonance mechanisms are explored to address the challenges of plasmonic sensing in 
the visible frequency range. The numerical and experimental investigation of the magnetic-type 
LSP resonance is contrasted with the electric-type used in conventional LSP-based sensing. The 
role of geometry, especially height, on the resonance mechanisms is studied, in which it is found 
that higher aspect ratio structures, realized by a cost-effective electrodeposition process, support 
hybridized waveguide-type modes which far outperform typical planar resonance mechanisms 
both in sensitivity and in figure of merit (FOM). Furthermore, the practical implications of the 
work are discussed.
