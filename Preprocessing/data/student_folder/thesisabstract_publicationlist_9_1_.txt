 
Abstract 
 
This thesis pertains to the analysis and design of switching amplifiers with substantially 
improved specifications over the state-of-the-art for smartphones, including higher power-
efficiency to address the short battery lifespan, lower noise, and wider bandwidth.  The specific 
switching amplifiers are the Class D amplifier (CDA) for audio applications and the hybrid CDA 
for supply modulators for envelope tracking power amplifiers.  For the former, we investigate 
and derive the mechanisms of the AC ground and their ensuing effects on Power-Supply-
Rejection-Ratio and Power-Supply-Induced-Intermodulation.  For the latter, we investigate the 
power mechanisms thereto and propose two architectures – the first with a novel delay-based 
hysteresis controller and Class AB amplifier, and the second with a novel dual-mode Sigma-
Delta control and adaptive biasing Class AB amplifier.  The proposed two architectures were 
monolithically realized.  The mechanisms of the former and functionality of proposed 
architectures of the latter are verified experimentally, and the measurements depict improved 
specifications thereto.
