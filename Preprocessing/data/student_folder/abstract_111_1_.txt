ABSTRACT 
 
In this PhD study, a new approach to implement integrated capacitors with 
superb capacitance density, termed “three-dimensional (3D) embedded 
capacitor” is proposed. It is realized by embedding metal-insulator-metal 
(MIM) layers onto the trenches of through-silicon-vias (TSVs) prior to 
filling. The difference between conventional MIM trench capacitors and 
3D embedded capacitors is shown in Fig. 1. An ultrahigh capacitance 
density of 5,621.8 nF/mm2 is envisioned according to our model, which is 
~13×
 of 440 nF/mm2 from conventional trench capacitors with the same 
design parameters. Two sets of test vehicles were designed, fabricated and 
characterized for assessments of structure integrity and electrical 
performance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron 
microscope (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) 
analysis results show good step coverage and stoichiometry of the MIM 
layers. Capacitance density up to 3,856.4 nF/mm2 has been achieved for 
early prototypes with MIM layers formed by atomic layer deposition 
(ALD). Leakage current density as low as 1.61×
10-7 A/cm2 at 4.3V and 
breakdown voltage greater than 9.5 V were measured for a sample with 
capacitance density of 3,776.6 nF/mm2.
