Abstract 
The mental workload and multitasking capacity of an individual is an important consideration for operator 
and workplace safety assessment. Developing ways to understand and accurately assess mental workload 
is therefore essential. In this thesis, we study multitasking mental workload elicited from the simultaneous 
capacity (SIMKAP) psychology test, measured with the electroencephalograph (EEG) signal. Beginning 
with the individual specific case, we propose novel feature based methods for classification, drawing 
inspiration from previous work and psychophysiology. We then study general underlying neural 
mechanics of multitasking through EEG spectral analysis of the SIMKAP test and propose a subject 
independent classification model based on questionnaire ratings. Next, we consider generalization 
capability by transferring models trained on SIMKAP to classify a separate workload dataset and show 
that a novel 2-level autoencoder structure is able to learn features for stable transfer classification 
performance. Finally, we show applications developed for multitasking assessment and neurofeedback 
training.
