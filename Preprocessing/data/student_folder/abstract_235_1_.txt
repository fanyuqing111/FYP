Abstract
The National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) has been studied by many mar-
ket regulators and researchers and it is well-known for its distinguished maturity and
structure. A demand response (DR) program was implemented in April 2016 to further
improve its e�ciency and competitiveness. With the liberalization and deregulation of
the electricity market, it becomes more flexible for demand side to actively participate
in the wholesale electricity market. This has changed the way how electricity is traded.
In this research, a software-based assessment tool is developed for participation of
loads in demand response program of wholesale electricity market of NEMS
This work focuses on the study of Singapore demand response program featuring
demand side bidding and incentive payments. The impact of demand side participation
on the market is analyzed. The issues associated with the structure and operation of
the electricity market are addressed in this research. In addition, DR can be employed
in energy management to mitigate the di�culty brought by uncertain demand. Firstly,
the current market clearing model (MCM) of Singapore, which is the assessment tool
for the settlement of energy and ancillary services simultaneously, is introduced. The
mechanism of transmission loss and nodal prices integrated in the MCM is presented as
well. Secondly, the methodology of integration of demand side bidding with the newly
introduced requirements is discussed. Finally, a two-stage stochastic market clearing for
the coordinated operation of generating units and demand response (DR) is proposed.
In the future, the proposed modeling can be utilized for further evaluation on real 
time demand response (DR) and interruptible load (IL) strategies. The challenges 
to be addressed are also outlined while the solution is still under testing.
