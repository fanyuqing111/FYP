Abstract 
Demand Response (DR) is one of the most effective ways to reduce the building’s 
operating cost. This research work develops an optimal coordinated Building Energy 
Management System (BEMS) framework to study the control algorithms and demand 
responses in the building. The proposed framework provides a systematical 
construction of the BEMS which is adaptive to both the heuristic and deterministic 
approaches for solving complex optimization problems in the building. Moreover, the 
proposed smart combined ice storage strategy in cooperation with other DR programs 
in the building shows a better tradeoff between the energy consumption and building’s 
operating cost. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid cooling-and-ventilation control 
algorithm is developed and validated in the framework. The results show that the 
proposed BEMS framework not only can be used to validate the developed control 
algorithms in the system but also provides optimal coordinated controls of the building 
facilities.
