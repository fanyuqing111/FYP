Abstract 
With the development of renewable energy sources, microgrid is widely implemented 
because of its flexibility and the high-efficiency. There are always two concerns in the 
microgrid. The first one is power sharing. Generally, the output of the generator is 
proportional to its capacity to reach the highest efficiency. The well-known droop 
control can ensure proportional active and reactive power shared among parallel power 
converter system. However, its feasibility can be seriously influenced by some 
additional factors, such as line impedance mismatch and sensor error. Thus, in this 
report, the power sharing of the droop control with various disturbance is fully 
discussed and the corresponding method to mitigate the sharing error is proposed. The 
other concern is power quality. The effectiveness of droop control is limited in the 
fundamental-frequency domain and cannot address the harmonic issues. However, 
according to previous studies, the harmonic currents generated by nonlinear loads can 
distort the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage. It is also shown that apart from 
nonlinear loads, switching deadtime can also introduce circulating current harmonics. 
To simultaneously suppress the circulating current harmonics and mitigate the PCC 
voltage harmonics, a novel control strategy is proposed based on virtual harmonic 
impedance controls. The feasibility of the proposed control strategy is verified through 
the experiments.
