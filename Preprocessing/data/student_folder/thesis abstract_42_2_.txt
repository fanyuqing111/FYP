Strong interaction between localized surface plasmons and nanoscale objects has led to the 
development of highly sensitive biochemical sensing in planar metallic nanostructures with sensing 
performances mainly dependent on the interaction volume and the local electric field. However, the 
sensitivity and the interaction volume of these planar structures have been limited by the achievable 
aspect ratios based on standard lift-off process. Here, we propose combining electron beam lithography 
(EBL) for template definition with pulsed electrodeposition directly onto indium tin oxide-coated glass 
for structure growth. We first show the advantages of pulsed electrodeposition over that using direct 
current. We demonstrate how this can be used to fabricate arrays of high quality gold dimer structures 
with high aspect ratio sub-10-nm gaps. We also compare the sensitivity of the proposed high aspect 
ratio structures with that of their planar counterparts, and investigate the feasibility of using them as a 
practical biosensing substrate. We also demonstrate the process of using negative resist with 
electrodeposition to fabricate inverse structures.
