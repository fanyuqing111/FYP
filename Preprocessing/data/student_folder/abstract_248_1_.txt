Abstract 
Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) systems used in multipath rich channels are very 
susceptible to signal distortion due to Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) as well as signal 
attenuation due to destructive fading. Equalizers can be used to undo signal distortion due to 
Inter-Symbol Interference but any signal attenuation due to destructive fading would still be 
present and this would lead to lower effective data transmission rates.  
In this report, we propose a solution, which we refer to as the Real-Time Channel Estimator 
(RTCE), which helps to undo signal distortion due to Inter-Symbol Interference while 
reducing the effects of destructive fading as well and thus permitting higher effective data 
transmission rates. This is particularly useful for Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband systems 
operating between 3.1 GHz and 10.6 GHz which are subject to the low power emission 
restrictions imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  
In essence, the Real-Time Channel Estimator would estimate the Channel Impulse Response 
(CIR) function for the entire bandwidth of the IR-UWB communication channel and 
represents this in a well conditioned matrix form. We measure the singularity of this matrix, 
using the Singular Value Decomposition technique, to minimize the effects of perturbations 
due to channel noise. It would then attempt to determine the transmitted signal from the 
received signal using the Gaussian elimination technique. 
In the following sections, we review most of the commonly used equalization techniques and 
compare their performance against our proposed solution in a multipath channel with 
destructive fading characteristics. We then compare the Bit Error Rate (BER) of these 
different types of equalizers over various Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) values and their 
computational complexity and show that our proposed solution performs better than most 
commonly used equalizers.
