Abstract
Video anomaly detection has played a significant role in computer vision tasks and video
surveillance tasks. To detect anomalies in videos we need to address two problems: 1) anoma-
lies are difficult to define, different situations have different anomalies, and 2) the limited
anomaly samples: abnormal events and behaviors are unusual temporal or spatiotemporal parts
of videos. To address the above challenges and reduce the computational and memory cost, in
this thesis, we propose unsupervised deep learning and end-to-end methods for temporal and
spatiotemporal anomaly detection, respectively.
For temporal anomaly detection, we formulate it as fake data detection via the discrimi-
native framework of a designed 3D-GAN. This new formulation only employs normal videos
during the training phase and detects anomalies according to the deviation estimated by the
discriminator of 3D-GAN. For spatiotemporal anomaly detection, we design a 3D fully convo-
lutional autoencoder that is trainable in an end-to-end manner to learn the spatiotemporal repre-
sentation of normal visual patterns and how to reconstruct them with low errors. Subsequently,
spatiotemporal patterns can be detected as blurry regions that are not well reconstructed. We
evaluate the proposed methods for detecting abnormal patterns on benchmark video datasets.
Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our methods.
