Abstract 
In order to overcome the ever-challenging environmental issues such as the greenhouse 
gas emission, traditional energy sources are gradually being replaced by renewable 
energy sources. However, the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources leads 
to the decrease of power system inertia, as renewable sources barely contribute to 
inertial response. To tackle this problem, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which 
is composed of a battery and a supercapacitor, is proposed to enhance frequency control 
and optimize the system performance in this project. Besides, a sizing method for the 
HESS under contingencies is presented with the consideration of system cost and 
operation. Furthermore, the battery used for improving secondary frequency control 
performance is also considered. The effectiveness of the proposed HESS control 
method is verified through both short-term and long-term simulation results.
