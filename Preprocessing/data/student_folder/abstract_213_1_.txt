Abstract 
Currently, wideband receiver had become a highly popular research topic because of its 
capability to support both high-speed communication as well as multi-standard 
integration. Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless transmission standard was established by 
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to support high-speed transmission using 
bandwidth from 3.1 – 10.6 GHz. Software defined radios (SDRs) have enabled 
multistandard wideband receiver, which covers multiple wireless standards distributed 
over sub-6-GHz bands, such as WiFi, GSM and Bluetooth. The first building block in 
such wideband wideband receivers, wideband low-noise amplifier (LNA), is critical to 
the performance of the entire receiver chain.   
Noise cancelling (NC) interesting technique in wideband LNA design. It breaks the 
trade-off between input matching and noise performance of LNA. By adding two 
feedforward paths using two auxiliary amplifiers, the noise of input transistor is 
cancelled at output. The objective of this research is to explore this technique and 
propose a novel noise optimization method in NC LNA. Furthermore novel NC LNA 
architectures are proposed to exploit improvements in gain, noise figure and linearity. 
These architectures are verified through simulation as well as silicon measurements. 
A noise modeling and optimization method that is helpful in designing the frequency 
response of noise in a NC wideband LNA is proposed. A common gate NC LNA with 
a bandwidth of 3 – 11.4 GHz, covering the UWB bandwidth is designed and 
implemented utilizing the noise modeling method. Fabricated in CMOS 65nm 
technology, it has a peak gain of 14 dB with a minimum noise figure of 3.8 dB.

Measured IIP3 also shows a decent value of +2.1 dBm. 
Another wideband resistive-feedback NC LNA with an additional source-follower-
feedback (SFF), which improves both gain and NF, is presented. Fabricated in a 65nm 
CMOS process, the wideband LNA achieves a flat S21 of 16.8 dB, a flat NF of 2.87-
3.77 dB and S11 below -10 dB over a 3-dB bandwidth of 0.5-7 GHz. It consumes a DC 
power of 11.3mW from a 1.2-V supply and occupies an active area of only 0.044mm2. 
Finally, a common-gate noise canceling LNA employing PNMOS as distortion 
cancellation is proposed. It is crucial for wideband LNAs to achieve high IIP3, 
preventing in-band intermodulation interference. Fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process, 
the wideband LNA achieves an S21 of 12.8 dB, a flat NF of 3.3-5.2 dB and S11 below -
10 dB over a 3-dB bandwidth of 1-20 GHz. It shows an IIP3 larger than 5 dBm across 
the entire 19 GHz bandwidth and the highest measured IIP3 is 12.7 dBm.
