Thesis Title 
Active control of noise through open windows 
 
Thesis Abstract 
Active noise control (ANC) is a noise mitigation technique that preserves natural ventilation in dwellings 
when applied on domestic windows. ANC systems for open windows mitigates noise at the receivers’ end, 
which augment solutions that are less effective for urban noise in high-rise cities. The target of the ANC 
system is to reduce noise that propagates through an open aperture, such as a window, into the interior 
of a room. This thesis presents a systematic approach to the open window ANC system design to address 
the complex practical implementation challenges.  
Firstly, the fundamental limits of the ANC system in controlling noise through an open aperture are 
determined by numerical simulations. Investigation into the performance of different physical 
arrangements reveal that the upper limit frequency limit of control is determined by the separation 
distance between the sources of the planar array, distributed evenly in the aperture. As a result, the 
minimum number of sources required to achieve good control is generalized for an arbitrary aperture size 
and the dominant noise incidence angles.  
Next, an experimental setup with a full-sized domestic window is designed and installed on a room model. 
A total of 24 control sources of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ANC system are implemented 
on a fully opened sliding window. To determine the upper limit of control system performance, different 
active control algorithms are investigated using measured transfer functions from the 24 channel ANC 
system. The performance of the real-time 24-channel ANC system in attenuating road traffic noise is 
determined by the energy-averaged sound pressure levels from 27 microphones in the room interior.  
Lastly, strategies for practical implementation are discussed. Namely, omission of error microphones from 
the final design, dealing with residual high frequency noise, and high computational complexity of coupled 
MIMO ANC systems.
