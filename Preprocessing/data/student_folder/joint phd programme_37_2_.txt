Dear Zeyu 
  
We understand that you had discussed with Prof Rusli about withdrawing from the NTU‐ParisTech Joint PhD programme in 
the interest of time, that is you are acceptable to continue as a normal NTU PhD candidate. 
  
We would like to seek your confirmation in the above understanding. Once you confirm your decision, we will proceed to
put up to management to propose your withdrawal from the Joint PhD programme and continue as a normal NTU PhD
candidate.  
  
Thanks and regards 
Wei Jiuan
