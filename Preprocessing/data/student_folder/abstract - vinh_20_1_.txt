Propagation of light through scattering media such as glass diffuser or biological tissues is 
usually considered as a random process, challenging our optical access. My research demonstrates 
multiple approaches to not only overcome but also utilize the randomness of scattering media. 
First, I will demonstrate a phase modulation technique to focus light behind a scattering medium. 
Then, I will present a technique to move the focus spot swiftly in three-dimensional space behind 
the scattering medium by utilizing optical memory effect. With multiple focus spots, we can 
measure multiple point spreading functions to image the object behind the scattering medium 
computationally with expanded field of view. In the second part, I show a technique to utilize 
ground glass diffusers and their sensitivity with inhomogeneous refractive index to develop a 
simple and powerful optical sensor. Our detection limit of 12 ppm for glucose concentration or 
3.87×10-6 refractive index unit is comparable to many optical resonant sensors, which require 
advanced manufacturing techniques. 
 Key words: optical memory effect, spatial light modulation, focusing, imaging, scattering 
media, refractive index sensing.
