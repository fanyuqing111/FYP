Abstract 
 
With the rapid development of power management unit, switching converters are widely 
used as voltage regulators due to its high power conversion efficiency. In the context of high-speed 
applications that require different operation modes in the embedded systems, the frequently 
changing load current in specifications may induce significant undershoot/overshoot variations. 
This will deteriorate the overall system performance such as data missing, transmission errors, 
robustness and so forth. As such, it directly poses the design challenge for the switching converters. 
From the application prospective, fast-transient response becomes one of the key parameters for 
the design of this specific DC-DC converter. In this thesis, the representative fast-transient circuit 
techniques for DC-DC converters has been extensively reviewed. To tackle the issue, a new 
pumping control scheme is proposed to enhance the transient response of a voltage-mode 
hysteretic DC-DC buck converter in 40nm CMOS technology. Comparing with conventional 
counterparts, it is able to improve the transient response and reduce the undershoot/overshoot 
voltage together with the multiple undershoot/overshoot effect during the load current transitions. 
Besides, a detailed theoretical analysis is conducted to give the in-sight of circuit technique.  From 
the simulation results, the output voltage ripple is obtained at about 36mVpp whilst the 
undershoot/overshoot settling time is obtained as 620ns/550ns in response to a 200mA load current 
step. The undershoot/overshoot voltage can be maintained within 2%. The peak efficiency is 94% 
for the entire load current range. It has confirmed that these simulation results correlate well with 
the theory for validation of transient enhancement. The performance comparison has shown that 
the proposed circuit technique outperforms that of the reported works.
