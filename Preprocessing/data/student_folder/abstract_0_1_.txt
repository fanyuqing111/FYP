Abstract 
This PhD program pertains to the design and monolithic realization of high-speed high-
resolution Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC), particularly pipeline-based and successive 
Approximation Register (SAR)-based architectures, for next-generation telecommunication 
systems.  
For the pipeline-based ADC, we propose, design, and monolithically realize a novel 11bit 
1GS/s SAR-assisted MDAC-free pipeline ADCâ€”the first-ever reported MDAC-free pipeline 
ADC architecture. This architecture circumvents the well-reported critical issues arising from 
the MDACs, thereby leading to higher speed and higher accuracy, yet with potentially reduced 
design complexity. For the SAR-based ADC, we propose a 2bit/step 10bit 400MS/s SAR ADC. 
By means of our proposed 2bit/step conversion scheme, our ADC mitigates the speed limitation 
of the conventional SAR ADC, and achieves higher conversion accuracy, structure simplicity 
with reduced input loading, and reduced hardware complexity with minimal power overhead. 
Both two proposed ADCs are monolithically realized in 65nm CMOS, and when benchmarked 
against state-of-the-art counterparts, both featured highly competitive Figures-of-Merit.
