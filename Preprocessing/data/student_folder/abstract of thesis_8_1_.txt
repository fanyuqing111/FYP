Abstract of thesis 
 
Sesquioxide transparent ceramics such as Y2O3, Lu2O3, and Sc2O3, have received a 
great attention as promising host materials for high powder solid-state lasers. To meet 
the laser applications requirements, porosity of the ceramics must be minimized. 
Densification of ceramics is closely related to quality of powders, sintering additives 
and sintering techniques.  
 
In the present research, comprehensive studies concerning the powder synthesis, 
sintering additive behavior and sintering controls were conducted. It has been 
demonstrated that dispersants have great influence on the morphology and dispersity of 
both precursors and calcined powders. The utilization of spraying technique provided 
another way to reduce powder agglomerations. The role of CaO and CaO-ZrO2 as 
sintering additives in the Y2O3 ceramic densification were explored. By optimizing the 
powder quality and sintering strategy, rare-earth doped sesquioxide transparent 
ceramics like Yb:Lu2O3 and Nd:Y2O3 with high lasing efficiency have been realized.
