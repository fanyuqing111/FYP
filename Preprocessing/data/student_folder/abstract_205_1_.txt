A dual-path wide-power-range rectifier for RF energy harvesting is presented in 
this thesis. The proposed idea focuses on maximizing efficiency in harvesting 
energy from both ambient source and dedicated source to support extensive 
applications in wireless charging for low power devices. The harvester consists of 
a low power rectifier, a high power rectifier and a voltage-aware block. In the low 
power rectifier, novel DC-boosted gate bias technique is proposed to enhance 
power conversion efficiency (PCE) by improving forward peak current, reducing 
diode forward voltage drop and suppressing reverse leakage current. A novel 
internal body-biasing technique is proposed in the high power rectifier to regulate 
the transistors’ threshold voltage (Vth) for optimal efficiency. A voltage-aware 
block, which consists of a voltage detector, a switch and an adjustable-offset 
comparator, has been incorporated into the high-power rectification path to 
minimize overall power consumption.  
 
The proposed circuit is fabricated in 65 nm 6M/1P standard CMOS technology. 
Peak PCE of 70.4% with DC output voltage of 1.72 V is measured on the low 
power rectifier with input power of -5.5 dBm at 2.45 GHz when driving a 15 kΩ 
load. For high power rectifier, maximum PCE of 56.6% with DC output voltage 
of 3.37 V is measured with input power of 1.3 dBm at 2.45 GHz when driving a 
15 kΩ load. The chip is able to achieve PCE greater than 20% over an extended 
input power range of 19.8 dB from -13.5 dBm to 6.3 dBm.
