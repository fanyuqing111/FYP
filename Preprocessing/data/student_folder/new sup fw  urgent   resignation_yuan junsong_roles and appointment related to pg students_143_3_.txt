Dear Wei Jiuan, 
 
I have communicated most of my students and help them identify the supervisors they want. 
Except for Zhang Yexin (M.Eng), Yan Mengjia (M.Eng), Wang Qiyi (PhD ongoing, self‐financed), and Zhou Chunluan (PhD 
with thesis submitted), all the students have met the proposed supervisors, and both the proposed supervisor and the 
student agree to work with each other after I leave. 
 
I will update you the proposed supervisor for Zhang Yexin (M.Eng), Yan Mengjia (M.Eng), Wang Qinyi and Zhou Chunluan 
(PhD with thesis submitted), later on. 
 
Thank you. 
 
 
 
Regards 
Junsong Yuan
