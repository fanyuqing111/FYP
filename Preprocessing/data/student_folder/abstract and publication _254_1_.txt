Abstract 
Neuromorphic hardware is based on neuroscience. It provides great possibilities to 
mimic higher-level human brain functions. In contemporary neuromorphic hardware, 
artificial spiking neurons that mimic nerve impulse (spike) generation, the construction 
of their complex networks,and analogue or digital neuromorphic integrated circuits are 
of vital importance ~\cite{9620507020140601}. In this thesis, an algorithm 
implementation of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) and a design of configurable digital 
neuron is covered. A configurable algorithm of SNN based on Spike Timing Dependent 
Plasticity (STDP) model is implemented and experiments of different number of digits 
classification are carried out to help evaluate the result of using the algorithm to 
recognize hand-written digits from MNIST dataset. A flexible and programmable C 
code modeling for verification analysis of hardware is implemented. A review and 
comparison of architectures of present existing neuron models is presented. The 
classification is set to three main kinds: Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron models, 
biologically inspired neuron models and other neuron models. After analyzing, the 
reviewing results is shown in the form of tables. The design of a flexible digital neuron 
based on Linear Leak Integrate-and-Fire neuron model is introduced. By combining a 
state machine and register-transfer level, this hardware-friendly neuron is able to 
provide two kinds of leakage mode to users. Users can manually set several 
parameters according to different needs and conditions.
