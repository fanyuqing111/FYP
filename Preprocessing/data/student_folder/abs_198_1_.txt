Abstract 
Rapid advances in the research and development of robotic and automation technologies have 
completely revolutionized the manufacturing industries in the past years. Though much progress 
has been obtained in the research and development of robotic manipulation recently, it is still 
difficult to reproduce such achievement in the micro-world as the study of micro-manipulation 
opens up new research and technological issues which diverge from traditional robotic 
manipulation. 
This research aims to develop robotic manipulation techniques for optical tweezers that are able 
to manipulate biological cells or microscopic objects using multiple laser-driven fingertips. In 
the research, multiple optically trapped micro-beads are first utilized as the laser-driven 
fingertips, and several control techniques will then be explored to achieve various manipulation 
tasks, which are beyond the capability of manipulation using single optical trapping. The 
interactions between the manipulators and biological cells or microscopic objects will be 
analyzed to gain insight into the dynamic manipulation. Both theoretical and practical aspects 
will be explored in this research.
