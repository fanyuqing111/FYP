Abstract 
Broadband supercontinuum (SC) generation is of great scientific and technical interest, and 
emerged as one of the best broadband light sources in a range of applications including 
optical communication, precision spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical 
frequency metrology, hyperspectral imaging, light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and, 
chemical and remote sensing. Hence the broadband SC generation is of strong motivation. 
     Supercontinuum (SC), is a process of generating broadband optical spectrum by launching 
optical pulses into a nonlinear medium, continuous interaction of laser pulses with nonlinear 
optical medium leads to the emission of a wider optical spectrum with a bandwidth many 
times greater than the bandwidth of the launched pulses. The key nonlinear physical 
phenomena involved in this processes are stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), modulation 
instability (MI), cross-phase modulation (XPM), self-phase modulation (SPM), four-wave 
mixing (FWM) and soliton related dynamics. The SC generation compromises of two parts: a 
seed laser and a nonlinear medium. The seed laser can generate femtosecond (short) pulses, 
picosecond or nanosecond (long) pulses or even continuous-wave (CW) laser. The nonlinear 
media such as normal single-mode-fiber (SMF) or specialty fibers such as highly nonlinear 
fiber (HNLF), highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber (PCF), tapered fibers and soft-glass fibers 
like ZBLAN (ZrF4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-NaF). In this project, the carbon-nanotube (CNT) based 
saturable absorber (SA) is used for the realization of passively mode-locked femtosecond 
erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) as a seed to the specialty fibers, to generate the broadband 
SC generation and also to study the different aspects of spectral broadening phenomena 
inside each specialty fiber. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the generation of CNT-SA-based 
passively mode-locked femtosecond EDFL and generation of broadband SC spectrum from 
specialty fiber.

     The CNT-SA based passively mode-locked EDFL has achieved a pulse width of 620 fs with a 
pulse repetition rate of 18 MHz at a centre wavelength of 1565 nm with a 3-dB bandwidth of 
5 nm. The mode-locked 10 % output pulse peak and average power are observed as 0.21 mW 
and 18.5 W respectively at the stable mode-locked condition. Throughout this project, the 
CNT-SA based passively mode-locked femtosecond EDFL is used as seed laser to broadband 
SC spectrum from all the all specialty fibers.  For efficient activation of nonlinear phenomena 
inside each specialty fiber and, also to study the variation of spectral broadening with respect 
to the variation in input pulse power, the pulse power is further boosted through the 
amplification using a pulsed erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA).  
     The spectral broadening inside a 60-meter-long PCF with respect to the variation in input 
pulse power is observed. The input power to the PCF is varied from 0 dBm to 20 dBm and 
achieved a maximum SC spectrum bandwidth of 1050 nm from the output of PCF spanning 
from 1080 nm to 2130 nm.  In the next step, the spectral broadening inside the HNLF is studied 
with respect to the variation in input pulse power from 0 dBm to 20 dBm and obtained a 
maximum SC spectrum bandwidth of 1400 nm covering from 1100 nm to 2500 nm. In addition 
to input pulse power variation, here the length of HNLF is also varied and studied the effect 
of the length variation on spectral broadening and SC spectrum bandwidth.  
     In order to overcome the limitations of silica-based fibers and to extend the SC spectrum 
further towards mid-infrared (mid-IR) side, soft-glass ZBLAN fiber is considered. The input 
pulse power to a 25-meter-long ZBLAN fiber is varied from 0 dBm to 25 dBm. A maximum SC 
bandwidth of 2000 nm spectrum extending from 1100 nm to 3100 nm is observed from the 
output of ZBLAN fiber. The SC spectrum variation in the new kind of fiber i.e. in the tapered 
fibers is studied by applying to taper to the HNLF.
