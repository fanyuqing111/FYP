Non-Parametric Model for RSS-based Active RFID Indoor Positioning System
Abstract
Indoor positioning is a key technology enabler for future smart systems. This thesis proposes
several non-parametric models to improve RSS-based active RFID indoor positioning system in
terms of accuracy, processing time, and robustness. In geometric method, we propose the use of
density-based  cluster  detection  to detect  outliers  in  location  candidates, allowing  bilateration
method to achieve shorter processing time while maintaining the same level of accuracy and
robustness.  We  also  introduce  several  improvements  on  location  fingerprinting  methods.  To
improve the accuracy and robustness of the location fingerprinting when training points are sparsely
distributed, we combine two existing methods which are Location Estimation using Model Tree
(LEMT) and LANDMARC. Because LEMT method and its derivative rely on M5 model tree that
has long processing time, we propose the use of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) regression
model in place of the M5 model tree to shorten the processing time. We found that training input
must be filtered in a way that null data do not interfere the regression process of the ELM.
