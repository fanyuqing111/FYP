Research Interests: My primary research interest is focused on the laser interactions with 
materials. Comprehensive theoretical simulations, novel experimental processes and 
implementation of ultrafast & high sensitivity optical diagnostics are being carried out to 
investigate in detail how light interacts with materials. My desire to uncover the physics behind 
the laser interactions with materials has led me to conduct research activities that include 
dynamic laser ablation to remove substrate materials for surface nano-patterning and nano-
materials’ synthesis as well as super-resolution nano-imaging and nano-lithography down to 20 
nm via the combination of laser means with other advanced tools (AFM, NSOM and transparent 
particles).  
My secondary research interest is on applying my research outcomes to develop new techniques 
to solve the "Mission Impossible" issues in the field of:  Micro processing and Nanofabrication; 
Nano photonics: Plasmonics, THz technology and Meta-materials; Optical diagnostics for process 
real-time monitoring.
