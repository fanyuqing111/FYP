Henri Happy received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Lille 
1, in 1992. In 1988 he joined the Institute of Electronic, Microelectronic and Nanotechnology 
(IEMN), one of the Lab of University Lille 1, where he is currently Full Professor of 
Electronics. His primary research interests are in high electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) 
modeling. From 1998 to 2003, his research areas were involved with the design, fabrication 
and characterization (up to 220 GHz) of MMICs for optical communications systems. Since 
2004, his research area has focused on nanodevices, and particularly carbon devices 
(carbon nanotube, graphene). These activities concern understanding of fundamental 
limitations and improvement of high frequency performance of carbon devices, and their 
applications in emerging fields of RF circuits on flexible substrates. This includes graphene 
growth either on SiC and metal substrate, the new 2D materials such as transition metal 
dichalcogenides (TMDCs), fabrication and characterization of graphene FET. He is a leading 
investigator on the high frequency device research carried out under the European 
Graphene Flagship program since 2013. His experience is recognized by the community: 
he has presented many invited talks, seminars and tutorials. Henri Happy has authored or 
co-authored about 100 international publications and communications.
