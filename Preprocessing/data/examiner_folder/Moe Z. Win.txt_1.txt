BRIEF BIOGRAPHY
Moe Win is a Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the
founding director of the Wireless Communication and Network Sciences
Laboratory. Prior to joining MIT, he was with AT&T Research Laboratories for
five years and with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for seven years. His research
encompasses fundamental theories, algorithm design, and experimentation for a
broad range of real-world problems. His current research topics include network
localization and navigation, network interference exploitation, intrinsic wireless
secrecy, adaptive diversity techniques, ultra-wide bandwidth systems, optical
transmission systems, and space communication systems.
Professor Win was honored with two IEEE Technical Field Awards: the IEEE Kiyo
Tomiyasu Award and the IEEE Eric E. Sumner Award. He received the Copernicus
Fellowship, the Royal Academy of Engineering Distinguished Visiting Fellowship,
the Fulbright Fellowship, the IEEE Communications Society Edwin H. Armstrong
Achievement Award, the International Prize for Communications Cristoforo
Colombo, the Laurea Honoris Causa from the University of Ferrara, the Technical
Recognition Award of the IEEE ComSoc Radio Communications Committee, and

the U.S. Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. He is elected
Fellow of the AAAS, the IEEE, and the IET, and served as an IEEE Distinguished
Lecturer. 
Professor Win was an elected Member-at-Large on the IEEE Communications
Society Board of Governors (2011-2013). He was the Chair (2004-2006) and
Secretary (2002-2004) for the Radio Communications Committee of the IEEE
Communications Society. He is currently an Editor-at-Large for the IEEE Wireless
Communications Letters. He served as Editor (2006–2012) for the IEEE
Transactions on Wireless Communications, and served as Area Editor (2003-2006)
and Editor (1998-2006) for the IEEE Transactions on Communications.
