(1) Education 
He have obtained the first degree at the Technical University of Budapest, Hungary 
and subsequently his DPhil degree at the University of Oxford. After completing 
his post graduate studies, He did his post-doctoral studies at the Universities of 
Cambridge and Oxford. He was appointed Lecturer in Photonics in 2002 at 
Imperial College London and in 2006 He was promoted to Reader in Optics and in 
2009 to Professor of Optical Physics.  
(2) Research Interests 
His research interests include the theory of electromagnetic problems, diffraction, 
focusing and microscopy with especial emphasis on confocal microscopy and 
optical data storage. For more information visit his group's webpage:
