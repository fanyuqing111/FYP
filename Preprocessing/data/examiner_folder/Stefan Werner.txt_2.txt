Research Interests
• Statistical signal processing
• Wireless communications
• Adaptive signal processing and machine learning
• Internet of things
• Smart electric power grids
Areas of Expertise
Wireless communications, statistical signal processing, adaptive filtering and learning. In these 
areas, he has published roughly 170 scientific journals and conference publications.
He has extensive credentials and experience on the advancing of theory and applications of set-
membership adaptive filtering and adaptive networks, which offer viable solutions to event-
triggered sensing, processing and communication in wireless sensor network. In this area he has 
developed and analyzed new approaches that feature reduced internode communication.

His research within wireless communication includes, e.g., analysis and design of full-duplex 
relaying, MIMO communication, and RF impairment modelling and compensation. The early 
publications on full-duplex relaying are highly cited and have opened up a new area of research 
which has been very active during the recent years.
More recently, he has looked into the development of smart grid technologies, particularly those 
that are relevant to advancing the communications and networking infrastructure of the power 
grid.
