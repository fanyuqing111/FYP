Research Interests
Current research is focused mainly on chemical processing, characterization, and 
applications of nanostructured materials and coatings and devices for energy conversion 
and storage as well as sensors and actuators. In general, our research can be grouped into 
the following directions:
• Engineering nano and microstructures for excitonic solar cells: dye- and quantum dot-
sensitized solar cells, inverted polymer solar cells and perovskite solar cells
• Design and controlled synthesis of nanostructured electrodes for rechargeable 
batteries: alkaline-ion batteries, metal-oxygen betteries, and flow batteries
• Electrodes for electric double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors
• Dielectrics, ferroelectrics, and piezoelectrics and devices
• Template-based growth of nanorod, nanotube, and nanocable arrays
• Dielectrics, ferroelectrics, and piezoelectrics and devices
• Organic-inorganic hybrids and coatings for sensing, filtration, corrosion protection, 
and surface modification
