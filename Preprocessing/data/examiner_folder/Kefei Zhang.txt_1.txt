Research Interests: Professor Kefei Zhang is the founder and director of the Satellite Positioning for 
Atmosphere, Climate and Environment (SPACE) Research Centre and the Satellite Positioning and 
Navigation (SPAN) Laboratory at RMIT University. Professor Zhang has over 25-year research experience 
in satellite positioning, geodesy and geospatial sciences. His current research interest is primarily involved 
in algorithm development and innovative applications of GNSS/GPS technologies for high-accuracy 
positioning, atmospheric studies (e.g. radio occultation, space weather, climate change, weather and 
environment), space situational awareness (e.g. space debris tracking, surveillance and collision warning 
and orbit determination) and people mobility and object tracking. He is a co-inventor of eight patents and 
has authored over 250 peer-reviewed publications in these fields and has attracted in excess of 20 million 
dollars in funding from the Australian Research Council, government, research organizations and industry 
sectors since 1990.
