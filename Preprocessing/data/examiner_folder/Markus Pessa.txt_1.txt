Markus Pessa received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Turku, Turku, 
Finland, in 1972. 
 
He is the Founder and Director of the Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC), Tampere 
University of Technology, Tampere, Finland,  the largest organization of optoelectronics 
and ultra-fast optics in Finland, where he is also a Professor of semiconductor technology. 
He has played a seminal role in establishing laser fabrication industry in Finland. He has 
authored 400 journal articles on optoelectronics, semiconductor physics, electron 
spectroscopy, and surface science. 
 
Dr. Pessa was elected a Foreign Associate of the United States National Academy of 
Engineering (NAE) in 2006, as the first Finnish citizen. He is a Knight, First Class, of the 
Order of the White Rose of Finland, awarded by the President of the Republic of Finland, 
1996, and was designated Professor of the Year (Finland) by the Trade Union of 
University Professors, 1998. He is a Member of the Editorial Boards of New Journal of 
Physics (London) and IEE Optics Proceedings (London). He is also a Member of the 
Board of Directors of the Kista Photonics Research Center (Royal Institute of 
Technology, Sweden) and the Finnish Cultural Insitute in Tokyo (Japan), and is a Fellow 
of the Institute of Physics (London).
