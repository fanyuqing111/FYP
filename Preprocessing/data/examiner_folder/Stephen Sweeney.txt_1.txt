Professor Stephen Sweeney obtained a BSc in Applied Physics and Qualified Teacher 
Status (QTS) from the University of Bath and a PhD in Semiconductor Laser Physics 
from the University of Surrey. Following his PhD and postdoctoral positions at Surrey, 
he joined Marconi Optical Components as a Scientist, becoming Lead Scientist of the 
Laser and Amplifier Technology group. In 2002, he returned to Surrey as a Lecturer, 
promoted to Chair in Physics in 2010. He led the photonics group based in the 
Advanced Technology Institute from 2010-2015 and was Head of the Department of 
Physics from 2015-2018. Working closely with industry, his research interests focus on 
developing new semiconductor systems for use in photonic devices such as lasers and 
photovoltaics and in the development of new photonic systems for use in 
communications, lighting, energy, biosciences, health and the emerging field of space-
based photonics. His work has led to a large number of published and edited journal 
papers, book chapters and patents. In 2009 he was awarded a prestigious EPSRC 
Leadership Fellowship allowing him to focus on developing near- and mid-infrared 
laser technologies for applications in high efficiency optical communications, sensing 
and photonic integration. 
In addition to his role at Surrey, he is the Chief Technology Officer for UK photonics 
start-up Zinir Ltd, he sits on the Editorial Boards of IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics 
and Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, has guest edited IET 
Optoelectronics, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics and IoP 
Semiconductor Science and Technology. He is a member of the EPSRC III-V National 
Centre Steering Committee, the EPSRC College and the Institute of Physics 
Semiconductor Physics committee. He serves as an expert international advisor for the 
EU and several national funding agencies such as the Department of Energy (USA), 
National Science Foundation (USA), Singapore Research Agency, Enterprise Ireland, 
Leibnitz Foundation amongst others. He sits on the committees for a number of 
international conferences and has chaired several conferences in semiconductors and 
photonics. In 2015 he was President of the Physics and Astronomy section of the British 
Science Association. 
Stephen is passionate about science and the role it plays in the health and wealth of 
people. He enjoys engaging with people of all ages and regularly gives talks at schools,

interviews for the national press and is an advocate for UK science and technology 
globally.
