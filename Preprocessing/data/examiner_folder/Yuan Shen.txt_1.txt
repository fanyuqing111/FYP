Welcome
I am an Associate Professor with the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua 
University, Beijing, China since 2014. Prior to that, I was a research assistant and then 
postdoctoral associate in the EECS Department at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT), affiliated with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems 
(LIDS), from 2005 to 2014. 
I received my Ph.D. and S.M. degree in EECS from MIT in 2014 and 2008, respectively, 
and B.E. degree in EE from Tsinghua University in 2005. My Ph.D. advisor was Professor 
Moe Z. Win. My research interests include statistical inference, network sciences, 
optimization and control, communication theory, and information theory. I am current 
working on network localization and navigation, resource allocation, inference 
techniques, intrinsic wireless secrecy, and cooperative networks.
Students and Postdocs: I am looking for highly motivated students and postdoctoral 
researchers with solid mathematics background, who are interested in statistical 
inference, network sciences, and optimization and control.
