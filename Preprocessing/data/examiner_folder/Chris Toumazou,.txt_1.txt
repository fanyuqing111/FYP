Professor Chris Toumazou, Regius Professor of Engineering, 
Chair in Biomedical Circuit Design, Director of the Centre for 
Bio-Inspired Technology and Founder and Chief Scientist for the 
Institute of Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College. He is 
also Founder, Chairman or CEO of two successful Medical 
Device Companies (Toumaz Technology and DNA Electronics) 
and Chief Scientific Advisor to GENEU. He is distinguished for 
his innovative silicon technology and integrated circuit design for 
electronic device in the field of devices for medical diagnosis 
and therapy. Professor Toumazou is pre-eminent amongst the 
global community of contemporary medical engineers. In 1994 
Toumazou was appointed the youngest Professor ever to be 
appointed at Imperial College, at the age of 33. In 2013 he 
became London’s First Regius Professor of Engineering 
conferred to Imperial College during the Queen’s Diamond 
Jubilee.
Toumazou’s research include cochlear implants for born-deaf 
children, an artificial pancreas for type 1 diabetics, wireless 
heart monitors for personalised ambulatory health monitoring 
pre- and post- operatively, inventing semiconductor-based DNA 
sequencing and inventing an intelligent neural stimulator as a 
drug alternative for obesity. In this and many other areas he has 
published over 750 research papers, holds over 50 patents and 
employs over 300 people in his combined medical device 
companies and Institute of Biomedical engineering at Imperial 
College London
He is the recipient of the 2005 Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) CAS Education Award for 
pioneering contributions to biomedical circuits and systems. In 
2006 he founded (IEEE BIOCAS). He received the UK Royal 
Academy of Engineering Silver Medal in 2007 for pioneering 
contributions to British industry and the UK Institute of 
Engineering Technology (IET) Premium best paper award and 
the IEEE CAS outstanding young author award.  He was elected 
in 2006 to Academia Europea. In 2008 he was appointed to the 
Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering and the 
Fellowship of the Royal Society, which is the highest honour in 
UK science. He was appointed a Fellow of Academy of Medical 
Sciences in 2013 and is now one of the few who is a Fellow of 
three premium societies.

Chris received in 2009 the World Technology Award, sponsored 
by Time Magazine, for Health & Medicine; In 2011 he received 
the JJ Thompson IET Achievement Award for major 
contributions to the low power medical electronics industry. In 
2010 Toumazou received the Times Higher Education 
Innovation Award for his founding of the Institute of Biomedical 
Engineering at Imperial College. The Institute was formally 
opened by Her Majesty The Queen in 2009. In addition 
Toumazou previously created and founded one of the largest 
technology transfer laboratories in the field of radio frequency 
(RF) semiconductors for international collaboration. HRH 
Princess Ann formally opened the laboratory in 1996. In 2009 
his commercial laboratories at DNA Electronics Ltd were used to 
launch the Government’s Life Sciences blueprint and were 
visited by a ministerial delegation led by the Prime Minister. In 
2011 he was invited to speak at the prestigious TEDMED 
conference in San Diego. His lecture was entitled the “Biological 
IP Address”. He also won the 2013 Gabor Medal of the Royal 
Society for his invention of semiconductor based genetic testing.
In June 2014 Chris won the European Inventor Award of the 
European Patent Office and has become the first British winner 
of a prize in this contest since 2008.
