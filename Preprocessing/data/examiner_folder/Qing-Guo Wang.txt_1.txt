Brief CV of Qing-Guo WANG
WANG
Qing-Guo  WANG was born in Suzhou, China. He received, respectively, the B.Eng. in
Chemical Engineering in 1982, the M. Eng. in 1984 and Ph.D. in 1987 both in Industrial
Automation, all from Zhejiang University (ZU) of People’s Republic of China (PRC). From
1987  to  1989  he  was  a  PRC  Postdoctoral  Fellow  with  Department  of  Mechanical
Engineering/the Institute for Fluid Power Transmission and Control (A National Key lab of
PRC), ZU.  In  1989  he joined the Department of Chemical Engineering/the Research
Institute of Industrial Process Control (A National Key lab of PRC), ZU, as an Associate
Professor. He received the Young Scientist Award of the Chinese Association of Science and
Technology in 1990, and He was named as an Outstanding China-conferred Ph.D by the
State Education Committee of PRC in 1991. He held a Alexander-von-Humboldt Research
Fellowship  of  Germany  with  Me  -,  Steuer-  und  Regelungstechnik,  FB  7  ---
Maschinenbau,  Universit a

 t-GH-Duisburg from 1990 to 1991 and with Regelungs- und
Systemtheorie, FB 16 --- Elektrotechnik, GH Kassel Universit a

 t from 1991 to 1992. From
1992 to 2015, he was with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the
National University of Singapore, where he became a Full Professor from 2004. He is
currently a  Distinguished Professor with  Institute for Intelligent Systems (IIS)/School of
Electrical Engineering (SOEE), Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment (FEBE), 
University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa. 
His research interests have been in modeling, estimation, prediction, control, optimization
and automation for a wide range of systems including, but not limited to, various industrial
and  environmental  processes,  new  energy  devices/facilities,  defense  systems,  medical
engineering, and financial markets. He has published over 400 technical papers with 250 in
international journals and 13 in China journals. He received over 11000 citations with h-
index of 60 and i10-Index of 149. He was presented with the award of the most cited article
of the Journal of Automatica in 2006-2010 and was in the Thomson Reuters list of the
highly-cited researchers 2013 in Engineering (1 out of 250 worldwide). He received the prize
of the  most  influential paper  of the  30  years  of the journal  of Control  Theory  and
Applications. He authored or co-authored six books entitled, respectively, “Finite Spectrum
Assignment for Time Delay Systems”, 1999; “Advances in PID Control”, 1999; “Relay
Feedback: Analysis, Identification and Control, 2003, “Decoupling Control”, 2003, and
"LMI Approach to Analysis and Control of Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems with Time
Delay", 2007, “PID Control for Multivariable Processes”, 2008, all published by Springer-
Verlag. He is an internationally renowned researcher in the areas of system modeling and
identification, relay feedback systems, auto-tuning of control systems, decoupling control,
PID control, time delay systems analysis and control, state estimation, multivariable and
robust control. His exceptional publications and citations figures are a clear proof for such
statements. 
In  addition  to  his  world-class  academic  research,  he  has  rich  practical  development
experience and successful technological transfers to industries. He worked (the majority of
time physically) in a paper mill for 3 years during his Master and PhD studies and co-

-----
developed (with his supervisor and a classmate) the first-ever paper machine computer
control system in PRC which was put to its practical use in industry in 1985.  He then
participated and promoted its implementation in many paper mills during 1985-1990 before
he left China for Germany. This invention/development was given a 2nd-class Technological
Progress Award of the State Education Committee of PRC in 1990. The spin-off company
from this technology, 浙江双元科技开发有限公司, http://www.zjusy.com/?index.html, has
dominated the China market since then. After he came to Singapore in 1992, he developed
practical control systems for cleanrooms, furnace, crystallization, oil refinery and power
systems. He has collaborated with major control giants such as Siemens for dynamic load
dispatch, Yokogawa for multivariable decoupling control, Fisher-Rosemount/Emerson for
PID controller auto-tuning, Honeywell for multivariable control, Aspen Technology for
model predictive control, DuPont for real time optimal control, and Supercon Technology
for robust process identification. He co-holds five patents in USA and Singapore, two of
which have been licensed to USA. He has abilities to bring research results to practical
applications. He is a rare researcher who is good in both theory and applications.
He taught courses in Engineering Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Electronic Circuits,
Signals and Systems, Computer Control, Linear Systems, Servo Systems, and Multivariable
Control. He supervised two undergraduate projects on hand-on developmental work and
business feasibility study, respectively. His final-year projects are most popular among his
over-100-faculty-strength department and actually sought after by students (demanded by
them even after department allocation). He has supervised about 30 postdoctoral research
fellows, about 30 PhD students and about 30 Master students He got teaching awards
almost every year. He is recognized as a passionate and effective teacher.
 
For  his  professional  services,  he  is  currently  the  deputy  Editor-in-Chief  of  the  ISA
Transactions (USA), he was an Associate Editor of Journal of Process Control (an IFAC
journal), Jan. 2002-Dec. 2004, and he is currently on editorial boards of a few other
journals.  He was the chairman of the IEEE control chapter, Singapore, 2000, 2001, 2012,
2013, the chair of steering committee of Asian Control Professor Association, 2001-2002. He
was the general chair and program chair of the 4th Asian Control Conference, Singapore,
September 25-27, 2002, the general chair of the fourth International Conference on Control
and Automation, Montreal, Canada,  June 10–12,  2003, and  the general chair of  tenth
International Conference on Control and Automation, Hangzhou, China, June 12–14, 2013.
