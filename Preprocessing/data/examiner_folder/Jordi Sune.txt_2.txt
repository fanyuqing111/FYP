Brief Bio
Jordi Suñé is full professor of electronics at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) 
since 2002. He graduated and obtained the Ph.D.degree in Physics from the UAB in 1986 and 
1989, respectively. Research fellow at IMEC (fall of 1989) and at the University of Bologna 
(1990,1991). He has been Director of the Departent of EE, vice-director for EE studies at the 
School of Engineering, and member of the board of governors of the UAB. He has served in 
several Technical Committees of relevant international conferences related to electron devic-
es and reliability: IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting CMOS and Interconnect Relia-
bility Subcommittee (2000-2001), International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS) Device Di-
electrics Subcommitee (2000-2003,2012,2013), IEEE Semiconductor Interface Specialist Con-
ference (SISC) (1999-2001), the International Conference Insulating Films on Semiconductors 
(INFOS) technical program committee (2001-2005), the International Conference on Ultimate 
Integration on Silicon (ULIS, now EUROSOI-ULIS) technical program committee (2012-2016) 
and the Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium (NVMTS) Program Committee (2012-
2016). He was the first Spanish representative at the Scientific Community Forum of the Euro-
pean Nanoelectronics Initiative Advisory Council (ENIAC) technology platform during 2005. He 
has been the coordinator of the NANOCOMP research group mainly dedicated to the model-
ing and simulation of electron devices with a multi-scale approach during the past 15 years. 
Recently, he has founded a new research group (NEUROMORPHIC) dedicated to the applica-
tion of neuromorphic electronics towards improved understanding of the human brain pro-

cesses at multiple scales and to development of alternative computing paradigms based on 
biomimetic neuromorphic circuits. He has (co)authored more than 400 papers in internation-
al journals and relevant conferences, among which 14 IEDM papers, several invited papers 
and five tutorials on oxide reliability at the IEEE-IRPS (2001, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009). These 
publications have received ~5300 citations (~2000 since 2012) giving an h-index of 39 (22 
since 2102) and i-10 index (Google Scholar) of 109 (54 since 2012). In 2004, he received the 
award Distinció de la Generalitat de Catalunya per a la promoció de la recerca universitària 
(young researcher) with the project entitled “Nanoelectronics: electron devices for the na-
noscale”. In 2008 he was honored with the IBM Faculty award, recognizing a fruitful long last-
ing research collaboration with IBM Microelectronics. Distinguished lecturer of the Electron 
Devices Society of the IEEE since 2009, he was elevated to the grade of IEEE Fellow on January 
2010. In 2010 he received the ICREA ACADEMIA award from the Generalitat de Catalunya to 
fund a special dedication to research in the period 2010-2015. In 2012 and 2013, he was 
awarded the Chinese Academy of Sciences Professorship for Senior International Scientists 
for a joint project with the Institute of Microelectronics of this academy (IMECAS) on Resistive 
RAM. At present, he’s the local coordinator of a European project (ENIAC-PANACHE) on 
emerging non-volatile memories based on resistive switching. His present research interests 
are: transition metal oxide-based memristors, complex perovskite oxide based memristors, 
biorealistic compact modeling of memristors for neuromorphic applications, RRAM fabrica-
tion, characterization and modelling, applications of graphene and two-dimensional (2D) ma-
terials for resistive switching applications, investigation of the human brain by biomimetic 
electric-circuit simulation (SPICE) and analog circuits based on the combination of CMOS and 
memristors.  He still has some activity in the area of oxide breakdown and dielectric reliability 
in CMOS technology.
