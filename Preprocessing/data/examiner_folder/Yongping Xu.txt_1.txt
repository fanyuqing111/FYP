About
Yong Ping Xu graduated from Nanjing University China and received his PhD 
in Electronics from University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, in 1994. 
He joined University of South Australia in 1996 as a Lecturer. Since 1998, he 
has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
National University of Singapore and is currently an Associate Professor. Prior 
to his PhD, he worked for Qingdao Semiconductor Research Institute as a 
design engineer, R&D manager and Director from 1978 to 1987.
He has been involved in the research of integrated circuit design, currently 
focusing on applications in biomedical devices and MEMS/sensor interfaces. 
He has served the International Technical Program Committee of IEEE 
International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) since 2014 and Technical 
Program Committee of VLSI Circuits Symposium since 2017. He also served 
Technical Program Committee of IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference 
(A-SSCC) from 2009-2013 and Technical Program Committee Co-Chairs of IEEE 
Symposium on Radio Frequency Integration Technology (RFIT) in 2007 and 
2009. He is the Organizing Committee Chair of 2013 IEEE Asian Solid-State 
Circuits Conference (A-SSCC). He is currently a Distinguished Lecturer of IEEE 
Solid-State Circuits Society.
