Over the years, he has participated in a number of national defense pre-research projects 
independently or cooperatively, such as chief of the XP project, as the leader of the JG973 project 
and as the deputy director of general office for JG973 project; published more than 100 academic 
papers in all kinds of academic journals and conferences; won five prizes at the provincial level or 
above, including the first prize of the National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2006, the 
outstanding achievement award of the Chinese academy of sciences, the first and the second 
prizes of the Army Science and Technology Progress Award and the third prize of the Ministry of 
Science and Technology Progress Award in 2007. He is mainly engaged in the manufacture and 
test of CMOS integrated circuits, the ionizing radiation effect of MOS devices, the test method of the 
ionizing radiation effect of MOS devices and circuits, and the single particle effect of MOS devices.
