MECH4000D Experiential Learning in Robotics Technologies. This course provides an Experiential 
Learning in Robotics Technologies through 1) student-initiated designing and manufacturing of a practical 
Powered Wheelchair for an athlete with disability; and 2) active participation in an international 
competition, namely Cybathlon 2016. Spring 2016, Laboratory: 20 hours per week, self-learning and 
group discussion: 5 hours per week. Faculty in Charge:  Robin Ma, Michael Wang, and Christopher Chao. 
The HKUSTwheels team of 7 students was ranked No. 2 with a Silver medal as well as No.1 in Asia 
region in the first Cybathlon 2016 Powered Wheelchair race held in Zurich, Switzerland on Oct. 8, 2016. 
 
MECH2520 - Design and Manufacturing I Blended Learning (3 credits). The development is to deliver 
the stable and standard content via online videos, creating the opportunity for face to face activities, 
including: group discussion, case study sharing session, reflection and presentation, individual review 
section and in-class exercises. This new blended learning (BL) course consists of two main components, 
i.e. online and face-to-face (F2F). Fall 2017. Faculty in Charge: Robin Ma and Michael Wang.   
 
At Chinese University of Hong Kong (2000-2014): 
 
 
ACE2800 and ACE2810 Laboratory I & II: Revised projects and work contents of the laboratory courses 
with new facilities for the new ACE program, in an effort leading the Teaching Laboratory Development 
Committee between 2000-2002. 
 
ACE2020 Product Design: Developed teaching materials for this new course and taught it as the initial 
offering for the ACE undergraduate program, 2001. 
 
IDE2810 Design Realization Laboratory: Developed new experimental projects and facilities for the 
initial offering of the new IDE undergraduate program, in an effort leading the Teaching Laboratory 
Development Committee between 2000-2002. 
 
IDE3810 Design Innovation Laboratory: Developed the new course with laboratory projects design, 
specification, and equipment and facility development for the initial offering of the new IDE 
undergraduate program, in an effort leading the Teaching Laboratory Development Committee between

course, also for enhancement of the MAE programs, 2007-2008. 
 
At University of Maryland (1990-2000): 
 
 
ENME 414 Computer-Aided Design:  Designed this course and offered it as a new undergraduate 
elective. This course teaches the basic principles and techniques of computer graphics and geometric 
modeling from the point of view of mechanical engineering applications. These fundamental parts will be 
integrated with a CAD system to provide a comprehensive education experience in computer aided 
mechanical engineering. 
 
ENME 808M Design for Manufacture: Developed and offered the graduate special topic course which 
became a regular graduate course.  The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concept of design 
for manufacture and to study various approaches to the development of quality products. The course 
focuses on the principles of design for manufacture. Furthermore, the course discusses a number of 
specific methodologies and computer aided technologies for engineering design practice.  This course is a 
continuation of the transition from theoretical/analytical engineering to practical/applied engineering. It 
emphasizes more practical aspects of methods for engineering design applications. 
 
ENME 304 Engineering Design (Development only): I joined a three faculty member group for the design 
of this new course for a sequence of design courses for Mechanical Engineering major. The role of my 
participation in this UMBC Design Curriculum Revision Project in 1994 is to design course structure and

materials that incorporate open-ended design problems and computer-aided design and manufacturing 
technologies into the new curriculum. 
 
ENME 471 & 472 Integrated Product and Process Development (Project development): I participated in 
this new design course in Fall 1995 for teaching preparation. In summer 1996, I worked with Rohm & 
Haas Company and established an agreement for its support to design a commercial product as a year-
long student course project. I was responsible for developing the project for teaching the course in Fall 
1996 and Spring 1997. I took a leadership role in reshaping theses courses into a senior capstone design 
course, including renovation of its new lab, as the Chair of the Laboratory, Equipment & Studio 
Committee in 1998-1999.  
 
ENME 489B/ENEE 488Q Pinball Machine Project: This is a cross-disciplinary project course targeted 
towards electrical, computer, and mechanical engineers. As an Advanced Student Project of the College 
of Engineering, this course has one-year duration with approximately 20 students involved. The team 
project requires interaction among students majoring in electrical and mechanical engineering and the 
students learn the skills required to design a sensor-based system. I participated in the development of this 
course with three other faculty members. This course is to be offered in Spring 1997 and Fall 1997 and to 
be cross-listed between EE and ME Departments.
