Research Focus
My research area is in Networked Systems broadly defined. The focus is on system level design insights
drawn from characterization of fundamental performance limits of such systems. Core research disciplines and
tools that we engage include information theory, optimization, communication theory and signal processing. We
are generally interested in systems consisting of multiple entities that communicate, network and compute. We
are also interested in developing algorithms approaching or achieving optimal design criteria. There are diverse
applications of our research in multi-genre networks (for example social communication networks and tactical
networks), as well as wired and wireless communication networks of the future (for example Internet of Things
(IoT) and sustainable networking). More specifics topics are:
• Energy-Conscious Communications
– Wireless networks with energy harvesting nodes
– Energy and signal cooperation in communication networks
– Green distributed storage
• Information Security
– Information Theoretic Security
– Secure Communication over multi-terminal wireless networks
– New models and information theoretic guarantees for powerful adversaries
– Integrating information theoretic security to other security mechanisms for the IoT era
• Network Science
– New performance metrics emphasizing information content and semantics
– Fundamental limits of reliable information flow over social communication networks
– Methods for influence and trust optimization over signed/unsigned social networks
• Multiterminal Information Theory
– Information theory of wireless networks: capacity of models with state, feedback, and cooperation
– Interactive compression and function computation
– Compression of remotely observed sources
• Wireless Communication Theory
– Interference management for heterogenous wireless networks
– Resource allocation for multi-terminal wireless communication systems
– Cognitive wireless communication systems
