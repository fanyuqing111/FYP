Semiconductor photonic devices and systems for multi-functionalities such as light

-----
 
5
1. Emission: Development and accurate analysis of luminescent mechanisms of Si 
nano-crystal light emitters. First paper to demonstrate a Si nano-crystal embedded 
MOSLED that delivers multi-color electroluminescence up to 1 W with external quantum 
efficiency >0.2%. (worldwide record at the time). (OSA JLT 6, 1486-1491, 2008, and JAP 
97, 094306, 2005, and IEEE JQE 41, 441-447, 2005) The related publications have been 
cited more than 300 times with the highest one of 65 times. 
2. Emission: The first blue-light electroluminescent MOSLED using the Si-rich SiOx film 
with buried Si nano-crystal diameter as small as 1.7 nm via the development of spatially 
confined PECVD synthesis Si nanocrystals in ameliorated Si nanostructures.  First 
demonstration on “luminescent wavelength tunable Si nanocrystal for blue-light 
MOSLEDs” by synthesizing quantum-confined “1.7-nm large Si nanocrystals” within the 
SiOx film. (Opt. Express 18, 4449-4456, 2010) 
3. Amplification: Demonstration of “Si nanocrystal embedded SiOx strip-loaded waveguide 
amplifier with gain cofficient of 65-85 cm-1” and the laser diode injection diagnosis of 
small-signal power gain up to 15 dB.  This is the first demonstration worldwide on the 
small-signal power gain analysis of the Si nano-crystal embedded Si-rich SiOx waveguide 
amplifier for future optical interconnects.  The waveguide amplifiers with gain spectrum 
in red, yellow, and blue wavelength regions were obtained. (Opt. Express 18, 9213-9219, 
2010 and APL 95, 021106, 2009).  
4. Depolarization: Innovative use of a semi-classical multi-layer graded-index model on the 
theoretical elucidation of the preliminary observation of “surface nonlinear depolarization 
effect” of the anti-glare Si nano-pillars employed as the surface of LEDs or solar cells. 
(Opt. Express 17, 20824-20832, 2009)  This model was also used to simulate wavelength 
dependent ultra-low surface reflectance spectrum with diminishing Brewster angle. 
5. Conversion: “Semiconductor quantum-dot laser diode or optical amplifier based optical 
data format conversion or mode-locking fiber laser using dark-optical-comb 
injection-locking”.  Related publications (Optics Express, 12, 2017-2026, 2004, Optics 
Express 12, 4449-4456, 2004, Optics Express, 13, 1008-1014, 2005, Optics Letters 31, 
1376-1378, 2006, etc.) have received 100 citations internationally.  This investigation 
subsequently led to the milestone work of “50-fs soliton pulse” (the world new record, all 
published in Optics Express and Optics Letters from 2004-2010). A representative work 
was awarded as the Third Hsu Yu-Ziang Best Paper Award of Science and Technology in 
recognition of its unique contribution to the all-optical data processing.  
6. Switching: The pioneer work demonstrated the “sub-picosecond carrier lifetime” and 
“picosecond optoelectronic switching” responses of “arsenic nano-cluster doped GaAs” 
material. (APL, 67, 3465-3467, 1995).  This paper has received 54 citations and related 
papers receive total citation number up to 150. 
7. Switching: The pioneer work on the” Gold-in-Ga2O3 peapod nanowires based 
nanophotonic switch” with photoconductive responses. (Nano Lett. 8, 3081-3085, 2008, 29 
citations in three years)  This work was published only two years with a rapidly 
increasing citation rate.  
8. Pulsation: Employing the carbon-nanotube/PVA composite for passively mode-locking the 
Er-doped fiber lasers (Opt. Express, 18, 3592-3600, 2010).  This achievement is based on

his previous work of “Study the pulse steepening effect of a 29-fs passively mode-locked 
Er-doped soliton fiber laser via pre-chirped amplification compression technology” (Opt. 
Lett. 31, 1382-1384, 2006. Selected by Virtual J. Ultrafast Sci. 5, No. 7, 2006). Earlier 
mode-locking laser work was quoted by Dr. Jeff Hecht’s historical review article published 
in Photonics Spectra 2004.
