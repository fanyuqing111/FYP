BIOGRAPHY
Howard Luong received his BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer 
Sciences (EECS) from University of California at Berkeley in 1988, 1990, and 1994, respectively. 
Since September 1994, he has joined the ECE faculty at the Hong Kong University of Science and 
Technology where he is currently a professor. 
Professor Luong's research interests are in RF/mm-Wave/sub-THz and analog integrated circuits 
and systems for wireless, portable, and bio-medical applications.  He was a co-author of the three 
technical books entitled “Design Techniques for Transformer-Based VCOs and Frequency 
Dividers” by Springer in November 2015, "Low-Voltage RF CMOS Frequency Synthesizers" by 
Cambridge University Press in August 2004, and "Design of Low-Voltage CMOS Switched-
Opamp Switched-Capacitor Systems" by Kluwer Academic Publishers in July 2003. 
Professor Luong is an IEEE Fellow.  He is currently serving as an Associate Editor of IEEE Solid-
State Circuits Letters (SSCL) and IEEE Virtual Journal on RFIC and a technical program 
committee member of IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC).  He was an 
IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society Distinguished Lecturer from 2012 to 2014 and an Associate 
Editor for IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I (TCAS-I) and TCAS-II from 2010 to 
2012 and from 1999 to 2002, respectively.
Professor Luong is serving on the Engineering Panel of Hong Kong Research Grants Council 
(RGC), the Technology Review Panel for Hong Kong ASTRI R&D Centre, and the Disciplinary 
Tribunal Panel (Electricity) of Hong Kong Government.
