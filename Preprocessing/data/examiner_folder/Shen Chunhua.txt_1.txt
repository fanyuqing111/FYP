Biography 
Chunhua Shen is a Professor at School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide. He is a Project 
Leader and Chief Investigator at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision 
(ACRV), for which he leads the project on machine learning for robotic vision. Before he moved to 
Adelaide as a Senior Lecturer, he was with the computer vision program at NICTA (National ICT 
Australia), Canberra Research Laboratory for about six years. His research interests are in the intersection 
of computer vision and statistical machine learning. Recent work has been on large-scale image retrieval 
and classification, object detection and pixel labelling using deep learning.  
He studied at Nanjing University, at Australian National University, and received his PhD degree from 
the University of Adelaide. From 2012 to 2016, he holds an Australian Research Council Future 
Fellowship. He is serving as Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning 
Systems.
