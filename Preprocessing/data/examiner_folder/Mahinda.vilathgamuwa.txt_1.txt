Ph D (Electrical Engineering) (University of Cambridge) 
Senior Member, IEEE.
Area of research: Power Electronics, Electromobility, Wireless Power, Electrical Drives, Renewable Energy;   I am most interested in how electric power can be 
generated and utilized efficiently.  My main focus is on the development of efficient energy conversion processes using new power semiconductor devices along with 
novel converter topologies and electromechanical systems. With the electrification and automation of many aspects of our lives, it is of paramount important that 
energy is converted efficiently and economically. Presently, evolving paradigm shift within the energy sector revolutionizes the way energy is generated via modern 
energy sources and how energy is stored using novel storage devices.  This is a challenging yet fascinating task for many contemporary power engineering 
professionals in today’s world.   Academic Qualifications:
