Ali Arefi received a B.Sc. (Honours), M.Sc., and Ph.D. all in electrical engineering in 1999, 2001, and 2011, respectively. He 
has been a lecturer and Research Fellow in Queensland University of Technology (QUT) since 2012. During this time, he has 
developed an automated tool for optimal investment strategy in electric distribution networks over large areas and long 
planning horizons for Energy Queensland Limited. He is a chief investigator in the awarded Discovery Project titled 
“Transition to Customer Response Driven Networks”, which is funded $390k by Australian Research Council (ARC) in 2015. 
Moreover, he is contributor/author of two research grants including Linkage Project funded more than $0.5M by ARC and 
supply industry. He is an IEEE Senior member and a member of several IEEE Working Groups and Committee and Task Force.
