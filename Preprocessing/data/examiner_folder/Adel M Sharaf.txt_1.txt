The Mission of Universities in the new millennium is to provide adequate educational resources 
and learning services that foster innovation, creativity and discovery as well as embrace an 
inclusive global culture that is both welcoming and diverse. 
 
The University should harness science and technology for the development and economic 
prosperity in all walks of life and to provide needed expertise to solve industrial, environmental, 
health, agricultural and medical problems, hence promote prosperity, welfare and wellness of the 
whole population. 
 
The University should be fully engaged in community by realizing the three pillars of academic 
life, namely: teaching, research and community service. 
 
A harmonious University environment has four essential pillars, namely: transparency, 
collegiality, accountability and diversity. 
 
The training of a fully productive and ethical work fore requires flexible inter-disciplinary and 
multi-disciplinary programs and associated soft skills of communications, entrepreneurship, 
design skills and group dynamics. 
 
The Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences is always the flagship of any University with 
the mandate to introduce new programs and innovative curricula and emphasizes the following 
five areas: 
 
� 
Design skills, hands-on, communications and soft skills, entrepreneurship, group 
dynamics and self learning 
� 
Basic sciences and mathematics courses tailored to engineering and open-ended 
problem solving 
� 
Multi-disciplinary approach to engineering education 
� 
Engineering learning up-front. 
� 
Scholarly teaching. 
 
The role of morality and ethics in the engineering education is very crucial and should be fully 
entrenched in all aspects of teaching and learning.  
 
** “EDUCATION WITHOUT MORAL VALUES, AS USEFUL AS IT IS, SEEMS 
RATHER TO MAKE A MAN A MORE  CLEVER  DEVIL”--- (C.S. Lewis)

** “The Principle Mark of a Genius is not Perfection but Originality, The opening of New 
Frontiers” (Arthur Koestler) 
 
The need to address rapid world technological changes and their global impact on the 
international economy and the tilting employment markets are paramount to ensuring the 
University’s long term competitiveness and responsiveness. 
 
New innovative multi-disciplinary, inter-department and inter-faculty Engineering and Science, 
Engineering and Arts integrated programs is a shear necessity in new areas of communications 
and information technology (CY&IT), Bioengineering, Bioinformatics, Biometrics, Nano 
Technology / Intelligent Sensors, Materials Engineering, Parallel and Super Computing, 
Engineering Technology Management, Entrepreneurship and Soft Computing, and Distributed 
Intelligence. 
 
The role of value added research in the enhancement of the process of discovery and scholarly 
teaching should be fully strengthened.  The University environment should promote a vibrant, 
free and inclusive culture that promotes and rewards excellence as well as embrace and welcome 
diversity. 
 
Sustainability requires effective recruitment and marketing of excellence that can be 
strengthened by real partnerships and close links with community, industry, government, NGO 
and all stakeholders both nationally and internationally.  Internationalization of the University is 
must! 
 
The University should advocate an integrated student centered learning environment and 
mentorship that sustains both life-long learning and self-learning using technology enabled 
teaching tools such as  distance learning, and satellite/web/internet/on-line learning.  
International academic links and research channels are crucial for marketing educational, 
research and consulting assets as a value added commodity both nationally and internationally. 
 
Education quality validation via learning outcome assessment plan and annual quality assurance 
process using assessment feedback metrics are required to monitor accountability, 
teaching/learning excellence and in turn, guarantee both sustainability and competitiveness.

The 21St Century is facing three key Challenges namely: Energy, Environment and Water 
Resources. 
 
Energy Sustainability, Conservation and Demand Side Management are strategic issues 
for any Nation, in particular for the development of Egypt and the Arab countries. So, it 
is important to solve the problem of energy management to improve the power quality 
and increase the competition ability of the national industries. 
 
On the other hand, well established problems of energy efficient utilization, Efficiency 
Enhancement, Loss reduction, Power saving are emerging all over the world as a 
consequence of limited primary Fossil energy resources available. 
 
Sustainable/Renewable/Green Power-Energy Sources and Efficient Use coupled with 
ensured levels of Power Quality, Demand Side Management and Energy Conservation 
must be addressed and utilized by all Engineers and Technologists in all sectors of the 
Economy. Energy is becoming a rare Commodity and Renewable Green Energy Sources 
will be the WAY OF THE FUTURE! 
 
The Research-Leader is Professor Dr. Adel M. Sharaf. He has over thirty five (35) years 
of Industrial, Electric Utility, Business, Engineering-Consulting, Academic Research, R 
& D experience in Canada and Abroad. 
 
The Sustainable Electric Energy Research Center has an ambitious plan to Lead the 
Research and Development in the areas of Renewable, Green Power and sustainable 
Energy Sources, Energy Conservation and Demand Side Management as well as develop 
technical skills of the academic staff, graduating students and practicing engineers in all 
industrial and Business sectors in the field of Renewable Energy, Green Power, 
Hydrogen Technology/Fuel cells, Distributed/Dispersed Generation. 
 
The SEEC-Center will serve as a Catalyst in innovating R & D Value-Added Research in 
the key areas of: 
 
1) Leading Edge Research and Development and Technology Transfer 
2) Quality Training and Human Resource Development 
3) International Collaboration with International Centers around the World

4) Innovative & Sustainable Technology Marketing and Licensing  
 
Professor Dr. Adel Mahmoud Sharaf of the University of New Brunswick will also act as 
an International Liasion Officer and Resource person with both Advisory Duties and 
Joint Project Coordination and Research supervision. 
 
The New SEEC Research  Center aims to be a sustainable vendor of new Technologies 
and Engineering Marketable Solutions addressing Renewable/Green Energy, Energy 
Conservation Measures, Energy-Saving Green Plug Devices, Harmonic Active Power 
Filters, FACTS Technology Based  Power Quality and Voltage-Stabilization Solutions 
and Loss Reduction/Energy Management strategies for Residentail, Commercial, 
Industrial Electric Loads.
