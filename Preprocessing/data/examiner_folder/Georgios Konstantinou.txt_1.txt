Evidence of teaching performance
I believe that teaching and learning duties are an integral part of an academic. My teaching philosophy focuses on
using blended learning concepts and integrate technological aspects in order to deliver an interesting, rewarding
and fulfilling experience to the student.
My first course as a lecturer was GSOE 9141 - Smart Grids and Distribution Networks, a postgraduate
course of the graduate school of Engineering, for Semester 1, 2013. I have been the course coordinator and
lecturer for the past four years. A summary of the latest Course Evaluation (CATEI & MyExperience) reports
for GSOE 9141 is provided below:
