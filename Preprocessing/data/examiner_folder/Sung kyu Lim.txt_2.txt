Other Teaching Activities
3.2.1
New Graduate Course Development
Physical Design Automation of VLSI Systems: This course was offered in Summer 2002, Fall 2003, and Spring
2005 as a special topics course and became a permanent graduate course (ECE6133) in the School of Electrical and
Computer Engineering.
• Description: The objective of physical design automation is to transform a structural representation of a VLSI
system into a layout representation so that the resulting layout satisfies topological, geometric, timing, and
power-consumption constraints of the design. This course focuses on various design automation problems in the
physical design process of VLSI circuits, including: logic partitioning, floorplanning, global routing, detailed
routing, compaction, and performance-driven layout. In addition, the discussion of a number of important
optimization techniques, such as network flow, Steiner tree, scheduling, simulated annealing, generic algorithm,
and linear/convex programming are included.
• Motivation: A significant portion of today’s VLSI chips is designed with automatic layout generation tools. This
is the first course ever offered at the Georgia Institute of Technology that teaches VLSI layout automation.
