Career Highlights:
Michael Shur joined RPI in 1996. He has held research or faculty positions at the University of 
Virginia as the John Money Professor and the Director of Applied Electrophysics Laboratories, 
A.F. Ioffe Institute, Cornell, and the University of Minnesota. He is Fellow of IEEE, IET,APS, 
ECS, AAAS, and Vice-President for publications of IEEE Sensor Council. He received the van 
der Ziel Award from the International Semiconductor Device Research Symposium in 1999, 
the Senior Humboldt Research Award in 2002, IEEE Donald Fink Best Paper Award in 2007, 
and IEEE Kirchmayer Award in 2007. 
Research Areas:
Solid State Devices
Shur's work with plasma wave excitation in submicron field effect transistors (FET) and 
related device structures should allow his lab to develop a new generation of solid-state 
terahertz (THz) tunable devices that will support numerous applications in biotechnology, 
microelectronics, and defense. His research has shown that a short channel field effect 
transistor (FET) has a resonance response to electromagnetic radiation at the plasma 
oscillation frequencies of the two dimensional electrons in the device. The devices which use 
this resonance response should operate at much higher frequencies than conventional, 
transit-time limited devices — in the terahertz range — since the plasma waves propagate 
much faster than electrons. Recently, his team reported on a resonant detector operating in 
the terahertz range using an AlGaAs/GaAs 0.15 micron gate FET.
