interests
Professor Xiaoke Yi’s
research into
nanophotonics and
integrated microwave
photonics promises to
lead to breakthroughs
that will meet our
ever-increasing demand for information and communication systems that can process
high-frequency and wideband signals at lightning speed.
“Microwave photonics is a multidisciplinary field that brings together the worlds of microwave
engineering and optoelectronics, for applications in areas such as communications, radars,
sensors and instrumentation.
“These applications require ever-increasing speed, bandwidth, sensitivity, functionality and
dynamic range. They also need devices that are small and lightweight and have low power
consumption, strong immunity to electromagnetic interference and high mobility.
“Currently digital electronic circuits are the most widely used approaches for these
applications; however, the sampling speed of digital electronic is normally less than several
gigahertz. The unique capabilities of photonics for processing ultrawide bandwidth, where
high-frequency microwave signals are only a tiny fraction of the carrier’s optical frequency,
make it a promising solution to meet our ever-increasing demand for expanding the capacity of
information and communication systems and networks.
“My vision is to deliver major breakthroughs in signal processing and sensing that will bring
about disruptive changes in fields such as communications, defence and healthcare delivery.
“For example, I am currently working on a non-invasive sensing technique for glucose
monitoring in people with diabetes that is highly accurate, fast (real-time), low-cost, pain-free
and risk-free. This represents a major breakthrough in the development of non-invasive blood
glucose measurement devices that can provide stable and reliable results, conveniently and
economically.
“I first encountered fibre optics during my PhD, when I started to explore using light for signal
processing. Since joining the University of Sydney more than 10 years ago I’ve continued to
pursue my passion in photonic signal processing, and have driven this field from concepts to
discrete components to integration circuits and functional subsystems.
“Here I am surrounded by amazing colleagues who are passionate about their research and
about new technologies, and my research benefits from this supportive and collaborative
environment.
“The University’s recent $150 million investment in establishing the world-leading Australian
Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology also shows its commitment to a major
research focus on nanoscale science and its applications.”
