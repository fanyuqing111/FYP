Abstract: The problem of acoustic noise is becoming increasingly serious with the growing use of industrial and medical equipment, appliances, and
consumer electronics. Active noise control (ANC), based on the principle of superposition, was developed in the early 20th century to help reduce noise.
However, ANC is still not widely used owing to the effectiveness of control algorithms, and to the physical and economical constraints of practical
applications. In this paper, we briefly introduce some fundamental ANC algorithms and theoretical analyses, and focus on recent advances on signal
processing algorithms, implementation techniques, challenges for innovative applications, and open issues for further research and development of ANC
systems.

Abstract: We propose an active noise control (ANC) system for reducing periodic noise generated in a high magnetic field such as noise generated from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices (MR noise). The proposed ANC system utilizes optical microphones and piezoelectric loudspeakers, because
specific acoustic equipment is required to overcome the high-field problem, and consists of a head-mounted structure to control noise near the user's ears
and to compensate for the low output of the piezoelectric loudspeaker. Moreover, internal model control (IMC)-based feedback ANC is employed because the
MR noise includes some periodic components and is predictable. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ANC system (head-mounted
structure) can significantly reduce MR noise by approximately 30 dB in a high field in an actual MRI room even if the imaging mode changes frequently.

Title: Head-mounted active noise control system with virtual sensing technique
Author(s): Miyazaki, N (Miyazaki, Nobuhiro); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Source: JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION  Volume: 339  Pages: 65-83  DOI: 10.1016/j.jsv.2014.11.023  Published: MAR 17 2015  
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a virtual sensing technique to a head-mounted active noise control (ANC) system we have already proposed. The proposed
ANC system can reduce narrowband noise while improving the noise reduction ability at the desired locations. A head-mounted ANC system based on an
adaptive feedback structure can reduce noise with periodicity or narrowband components. However, since quiet zones are formed only at the locations of
error microphones, an adequate noise reduction cannot be achieved at the locations where error microphones cannot be placed such as near the eardrums.
A solution to this problem is to apply a virtual sensing technique. A virtual sensing ANC system can achieve higher noise reduction at the desired locations by
measuring the system models from physical sensors to virtual sensors, which will be used in the online operation of the virtual sensing ANC algorithm.
Hence, we attempt to achieve the maximum noise reduction near the eardrums by applying the virtual sensing technique to the head mounted ANC system.
However, it is impossible to place the microphone near the eardrums. Therefore, the system models from physical sensors to virtual sensors are estimated
using the Head And Torso Simulator (HATS) instead of human ears. Some simulation, experimental, and subjective assessment results demonstrate that the
head mounted ANC system with virtual sensing is superior to that without virtual sensing in terms of the noise reduction ability at the desired locations. (C)

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that Uses Simulated Annealing (SA) to estimate the linear and nonlinear parameters of a closed-box
loudspeaker system for implementing effective Mirror filters. The nonlinear parameters determined by W. Klippel's method are sometimes inaccurate and
imaginary. In contrast, the proposed method can estimate the parameters with satisfactory accuracy due to its use of SA: the resulting impedance and
displacement characteristics match those of an actual equivalent loudspeaker. A Mirror filter designed around these parameters can well compensate the
nonlinear distortions of the loudspeaker system. Experiments demonstrate that the method can reduce the levels of nonlinear distortion by 5 dB to 20 dB
compared to the before compensation condition.

Title: Binaural active noise control using parametric array loudspeakers
Author(s): Tanaka, K (Tanaka, Kihiro); Shi, C (Shi, Chuang); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)

Abstract: This paper reports the binaural active noise control (ANC) system developed to deal with factory noise. The control points are located in the vicinity
of the le� and right ears of a worker sitting along the production line. Due to the complicated safety requirements in the factory, secondary sources and error
microphones are not allowed to be placed near the worker. Therefore, the proposed ANC system employs the feedforward structure and adopts the
parametric array loudspeakers (PALs) as the secondary sources. The PAL is a type of directional loudspeaker that generates a much narrower sound field as
compared to the conventional loudspeaker. Once the proposed ANC system has been trained offline, the error microphones can be removed. The
performance of the binaural ANC system is successfully demonstrated based on a digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract: This paper describes a method to compute the far-field directivity of a parametric loudspeaker array (PLA), whereby the steerable parametric
loudspeaker can be implemented when phased array techniques are applied. The convolution of the product directivity and the Westervelt's directivity is
suggested, substituting for the past practice of using the product directivity only. Computed directivity of a PLA using the proposed convolution model
achieves significant improvement in agreement to measured directivity at a negligible computational cost. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.

Title: On adaptive covariance and spectrum estimation of locally stationary multivariate processes
Author(s): Niedzwiecki, M (Niedzwiecki, Maciej); Ciolek, M (Ciolek, Marcin); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Source: AUTOMATICA  Volume: 82  Pages: 1-12  DOI: 10.1016/j.automatica.2017.04.033  Published: AUG 2017  
Abstract: When estimating the correlation/spectral structure of a locally stationary process, one has to make two important decisions. First, one should
choose the so-called estimation bandwidth, inversely proportional to the effective width of the local analysis window, in the way that complies with the
degree of signal nonstationarity. Too small bandwidth may result in an excessive estimation bias, while too large bandwidth may cause excessive estimation
variance. Second, but equally important, one should choose the appropriate order of the spectral representation of the signal so as to correctly model its

-----
resonant structure when the order is too small, the estimated spectrum may not reveal some important signal components (resonances), and when it is too
high, it may indicate the presence of some nonexistent components. When the analyzed signal is not stationary, with a possibly time-varying degree of
nonstationarity, both the bandwidth and order parameters should be adjusted in an adaptive fashion. The paper presents and compares three approaches
allowing for unified treatment of the problem of adaptive bandwidth and order selection for the purpose of identification of nonstationary vector
autoregressive processes: the cross-validation approach, the full cross -validation approach, and the approach that incorporates the multivariate version of
the generalized Akaike's final prediction error criterion. It is shown that the latter solution yields the best results and, at the same time, is very attractive from
the computational viewpoint. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Ultrasound-to-Ultrasound Volterra Filter Identification of the Parametric Array Loudspeaker
Author(s): Shi, C (Shi, Chuang); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Book Group Author(s): IEEE
Source: 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING (DSP)  Pages: 1-4  Published: 2015  
Abstract: The Volterra filter is a favorable approach to represent a variety of nonlinear systems, including the parametric array loudspeaker (PAL), which is a
weak nonlinear acoustic system to create directional sounds. Using the Volterra filter to model the sound process of the PAL saves the computational cost of
solving the nonlinear acoustic equation. In the past studies, the Volterra filter is identified from the audio input to the audio output of the PAL, which is
known as the audio-to-audio Volterra filter (A2VF). In this paper, the ultrasound-to-ultrasound Volterra filter (U2VF) is recommended. The experiment results
validate that the U2VF outperforms the A2VF, in terms of the robustness to the change of the modulation index in the PAL.

Title: Linearization of loudspeaker systems using a subband parallel cascade volterra filter

1619  DOI: 10.1093/ietfec/e90-a.8.1616  Published: AUG 2007  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low complexity realization method for compensating for nonlinear distortion. Generally, nonlinear distortion is
compensated for by a linearization system using a Volterra kernel. However, this method has a problem of requiring a huge computational complexity for the
convolution needed between an input signal and the 2nd-order Volterra kernel. The Simplified Volterra Filter (SVF), which removes the lines along the main
diagonal of the 2nd-order Volterra kernel, has been previously proposed as a way to reduce the computational complexity while maintaining the
compensation performance for the nonlinear distortion. However, this method cannot greatly reduce the computational complexity. Hence, we propose a
subband linearization system which consists of a subband parallel cascade realization method for the 2nd-order Volterra kernel and subband linear inverse
filter. Experimental results show that this proposed linearization system can produce the same compensation ability as the conventional method while
reducing the computational complexity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3rd-order nonlinear IIR filter for compensating for nonlinear distortions of loudspeaker systems. The 2nd-order
nonlinear IIR filter based on the Mirror filter is used for reducing nonlinear distortions of loudspeaker systems. However, the 2nd-order nonlinear IIR filter
cannot reduce nonlinear distortions at high frequencies because it does not include the nonlinearity of the self-inductance of loudspeaker systems. On the
other hand, the proposed filter includes the effect of such self-inductance and thus can reduce nonlinear distortions at high frequencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed filter can realize a reduction by 4 dB more than the conventional filter on inter-modulation distortions at high
frequencies.

Abstract: A theory that predicts the behaviors of the Filtered-X LMS algorithm was derived by using a statistical-mechanical method. In this paper, the theory
is generalized to explain the system behaviors in the case of an actual primary path. In the theory, cross-correlations between the element of a primary path
and that of an adaptive filter and autocorrelations of the elements of the adaptive filter are treated as macroscopic variables. Simultaneous differential
equations that describe the dynamical behaviors of the macroscopic variables are obtained under conditions in which the tapped-delay line is sufficiently
long. The equations are analytically solved to obtain the correlations and finally compute the mean-square error. In order to generalize the theory to the case
of an actual primary path, the correlations of the elements of the primary path are absorbed. The generalized theory quantitatively predict the behaviors in
the case of an actual primary path.

Abstract: Acoustic noise problems become more and more serious with increasing use of industrial and medical equipment, appliances, and consumer
electronics. Active noise control (ANC) has been studied to solve such acoustic noise problems. ANC is a technique based on the principle of superposition,
i.e., an antinoise with the same amplitude and opposite phase is generated and combined with an unwanted noise, thus resulting in the cancellation of both
noises. However, ANC is still not widely used owing to the effectiveness of control algorithms, and to the physical and economical constraints of practical
applications. In this paper, we briefly introduce some fundamental ANC structures, and focus on recent advances on signal processing algorithms,
implementation techniques, challenges for innovative applications, and open issues for further research and development of ANC systems.

Abstract: We analyze the learning curves of the FXLMS algorithm using a statistical-mechanical method when the reference signal is not necessarily white.
We treat the nonwhite reference signal by introducing the correlation function of the signal to the method proposed in our previous study. Cross-correlations
between the element of a primary path and that of an adaptive filter and autocorrelations of the elements of the adaptive filter are treated as macroscopic
variables. We obtain simultaneous differential equations that describe the dynamical behaviors of the macroscopic variables under the conditions in which
the tapped-delay line is long. We analytically solve the equations to obtain the correlations and finally compute the mean-square error. The obtained theory
quantitatively agrees with the results of computer simulations. The theory also gives the upper limit of the step size in the FXLMS algorithm.

Source: 2012 IEEE STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP (SSP)  Pages: 341-344  Published: 2012  
Abstract: We theoretically obtain the learning curves of the FXLMS algorithm on the basis of statistical mechanical analysis. Cosines of angles between the
coefficient vectors of an adaptive filter, its shi�ed filters, and an unknown system are treated as macroscopic variables. Assuming that the tapped-delay line
is sufficiently long and exactly calculating the correlations between the past tap input vectors and the coefficient vector of the adaptive filter, we obtain
simultaneous differential equations that describe the dynamical behaviors of the macroscopic variables in a deterministic form. We analytically solve the
equations and show that the obtained theory quantitatively agrees with computer simulations. In the analysis, neither the independence assumption, the
small step-size condition, nor the few-taps assumption is used.

Source: APPLIED ACOUSTICS  Volume: 99  Pages: 43-50  DOI: 10.1016/j.apacoust.2015.05.004  Published: DEC 1 2015  
Abstract: The parametric loudspeaker utilizes an ultrasonic transducer array to transmit a directional sound beam in air based on the parametric array effect.
In recent studies, phased array techniques have been applied to achieve controllable directivity patterns or to change the direction of the sound beam. Such
a parametric loudspeaker is o�en referred to as a steerable parametric loudspeaker. In this paper, a dual beam generation method is elaborated. It aims to
transmit two sound beams from just one steerable parametric loudspeaker. The two sound beams carries the same audio content to different locations. This
dual beam generation method is compatible with the configuration of existing steerable parametric loudspeakers based on phased array techniques. As an
algorithm solution, the dual beam generation method readily improves the flexibility of the steerable parametric loudspeaker. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract: In this paper, we apply a virtual sensing technique to a head-mounted ANC system we have already proposed. Adaptive feedback ANC system can
reduce noise with periodicity or having narrow band components. However, since quiet zones are formed only at the locations of error microphones, an

microphones are placed near the opening of the ear canals. However, the intended locations at which the maximum noise reduction should be achieved are
near eardrums. Hence, we try to introduce a virtual sensing technique to a head-mounted ANC system to achieve higher noise reduction. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve higher noise reduction than the conventional system. Moreover, a subjective assessment result
demonstrates that the proposed system can also give higher noise reduction to human auditory.

configuration MR system is introduced at Shiga University of Medical Science in order to conduct microwave coagulation therapy by using near-real-time MR
images. However, this system has a fatal defect. When MRI device works to take images, it also generates serious noises (MR noise). Hence, an operator and
other medical staff (ex. nurses and anesthetists) suffer from MR noise and cannot communicate with each other during the operation. In this paper, we
therefore propose a head-mounted ANC system in order to reduce the MR noise, and sonic experimental results demonstrate cancellation performance of
the system implemented by digital signal processor (DSP).

Title: Volterra model of the parametric array loudspeaker operating at ultrasonic frequencies
Author(s): Shi, C (Shi, Chuang); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Source: JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA  Volume: 140  Issue: 5  Pages: 3643-3650  DOI: 10.1121/1.4966962  Published: NOV 2016  
Abstract: The parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) is an application of the parametric acoustic array in air, which can be applied to transmit a narrow audio
beam from an ultrasonic emitter. However, nonlinear distortion is very perceptible in the audio beam. Modulation methods to reduce the nonlinear
distortion are available for on-axis far-field applications. For other applications, preprocessing techniques are wanting. In order to develop a preprocessing
technique with general applicability to a wide range of operating conditions, the Volterra filter is investigated as a nonlinear model of the PAL in this paper.
Limitations of the standard audio-to-audio Volterra filter are elaborated. An improved ultrasound-to-ultrasound Volterra filter is proposed and empirically
demonstrated to be a more generic Volterra model of the PAL. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

Title: ON ADAPTIVE SELECTION OF ESTIMATION BANDWIDTH FOR ANALYSIS OF LOCALLY STATIONARY MULTIVARIATE PROCESSES

Abstract: When estimating the correlation/spectral structure of a locally stationary process, one should choose the so-called estimation bandwidth, related
to the effective width of the local analysis window. The choice should comply with the degree of signal nonstationarity. Too small bandwidth may result in an
excessive estimation bias, while too large bandwidth may cause excessive estimation variance. The paper presents a novel method of adaptive bandwidth
selection. The proposed approach is based on minimization of the cross-validatory performance measure for a local vector autoregressive signal model and,
unlike the currently available methods, does not require assignment of any user-dependent decision thresholds.

Title: Third-Order Nonlinear IIR Filter for Compensating Nonlinear Distortions of Loudspeaker Systems
Author(s): Iwai, K (Iwai, Kenta); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3rd-order nonlinear IIR filter for compensating nonlinear distortions of loudspeaker systems. Nonlinear distortions are
common around the lowest resonance frequency for electrodynamic loudspeaker systems. One interesting approach to compensating nonlinear distortions
is to employ a mirror filter. The mirror filter is derived from the nonlinear differential equation for loudspeaker systems. The nonlinear parameters of a
loudspeaker system, which include the force factor, stiffness, and so forth, depend on the displacement of the diaphragm. The conventional filter structure,
which is called the 2nd-order nonlinear IIR filter that originates the mirror filter, cannot reduce nonlinear distortions at high frequencies because it does not
take into account the nonlinearity of the self-inductance of loudspeaker systems. To deal with this problem, the proposed filter takes into account the
nonlinearity of the self-inductance and has a 3rd-order nonlinear IIR filter structure. Hence, this filter can reduce nonlinear distortions at high frequencies
while maintaining a lower computational complexity than that of a Volterra filter-based compensator. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
filter outperforms the conventional filter by more than 2 dB for 2nd-order nonlinear distortions at high frequencies.

Abstract: Feedforward active noise control (ANC) system using upstream reference signal can reduce various noises such as broadband noise by arranging a
reference microphone close to a noise source. However, the performance of ANC system deteriorates if the noise environment such as the arrival direction is
changed. This is because of the causality constraint that the unwanted noise propagates to the control point faster than the "antinoise" to cancel the
unwanted noise. To solve this problem, we propose an ANC system that estimates the arrival direction of noise using multiple reference microphones placed
around the control point, This system uses a tune difference of arrival technique to estimate noise source location and then optimize reference signal. Noise
reduction performances are examined through some simulations in this paper.

Title: IDENTIFICATION OF THE PARAMETRIC ARRAY LOUDSPEAKER WITH A VOLTERRA FILTER USING THE SPARSE NLMS ALGORITHM

Abstract: Volterra filters can be applied to a wide range of nonlinear systems, keeping only the low order kernels to yield a good approximation. The
parametric array loudspeaker (PAL), as a weak nonlinear acoustic system, is an attractive directional sound reproduction device. Volterra filters have been
adopted in the linearization system of the PAL that efficiently reduces the nonlinear distortion with no need of solving the nonlinear acoustic equation. In this
paper, the ultrasound-to-ultrasound Volterra filter is proposed, being inspired by the nonlinear acoustic principle, to provide a better systematic
representation of the PAL. Experiment results are presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where the sparse NLMS algorithm is carried
out in the identification.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) using a sub-adaptive filter. In the AEC, the step-size parameter of the adaptive filter
must be varied according to the situations where a double talk and an echo path change occur. The proposed AEC can appropriately control the step-size
parameter even if the double talk and the echo path change simultaneously occur because the optimal step-size parameter can be obtained according to the
output of the sub-adaptive filter and the echo path change detector is controlled through the double talk detector. Hence, the proposed AEC can realize
superior convergence property to the conventional one. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AEC can achieve higher ERLE and faster
convergence than the conventional one.

Title: Effect of the ultrasonic emitter on the distortion performance of the parametric array loudspeaker
Author(s): Shi, C (Shi, Chuang); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Source: APPLIED ACOUSTICS  Volume: 112  Pages: 108-115  DOI: 10.1016/j.apacoust.2016.05.013  Published: NOV 2016  
Abstract: The parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) is a type of directional loudspeaker that utilizes the nonlinear acoustic effect to create the audible sound in
an ultrasonic beam. Due to this unusual sound principle, it is inevitable that nonlinear distortion is incurred in the sound transmission of the PAL. Numerous
modulation methods aiming to reduce the nonlinear distortion have been developed on the basis of the Berktay's far-field solution, but they o�en perform in
an unexpected manner. The degraded practical performance has been credited to the inaccuracy of the Berktay's far-field solution. In this paper, we
demonstrate the effect of the ultrasonic emitter on the distortion performance of the PAL and suggest that the Berktay's far-field solution remains to be a
good model equation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) modulates the audio input on an ultrasonic carrier and relies on airborne nonlinear acoustic effects to generate
the audible sound output. The sound output is mainly confined in the beam of the ultrasonic carrier and thus shows a pronounced directivity. There are
three parameters that together influence the output volume of a PAL. They are the input level, modulation index, and ultrasound level. In existing PALs, the
volume knob is associated with the ultrasound level, while the modulation index is either fixed in the circuit or rarely adjustable by another knob. In this
paper, an automatic gain control is proposed to improve the sound quality of the PAL by minimizing the modulation index, maintaining the output-to-input
ratio, and ensuring the ultrasound level within the safety range. Simulation and measurement results validate that the proposed approach leads to a
reduction in the average total harmonic distortion (THD) level by more than one third for all the tested modulation methods.

Abstract: The ultrasound-to-ultrasound Volterra filter (U2VF), which was previously proposed to represent the nonlinear response of the parametric array
loudspeaker (PAL), identifies the PAL as a nonlinear system that uses ultrasonic signals as its input. It has been proven that the U2VF is a more generic model
as compared to the audio-to-audio Volterra filter (A2VF), when the modulation method is adaptive or the input is time varying. However, there is no explicit
solution to a linearization system based on the U2VF. Therefore, this paper proposes a synthesis method to extract A2VFs from the U2VF based on the parallel
cascade structure. The mature technique of building a linearization system based on the A2VF can hence be adapted to consort with the U2VF.

Abstract: The parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) is well known for its ability to radiate a narrow sound beam from a relatively small ultrasonic emitter.
Nonlinear distortions commonly occur in the self-demodulated sound of the PAL. Based on the Volterra filter modeling the self-demodulation process of the
PAL, a linearization system can be developed for the PAL. However, the computational complexity of the Volterra filter increases dramatically with the tap
length. In this paper, the parallel cascade structure is adopted to implement the Volterra filter. The experiment results demonstrate that the computational
complexity of the Volterra filter is significantly reduced by using the parallel cascade structure, and based on such an implementation of the Volterra filter,
the performance of the linearization system is not compromised.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of Multi-channel feedforward active noise control (ANC) system combined with noise source separation
through some simulations. Multi-channel feedforward ANC system can reduce various noise such as the broad-band noise by arranging the reference
microphones close to noise sources. However, the performance of ANC system deteriorates when the reference microphones cannot be arranged close to
noise sources because each microphone catches undesired noise in addition to desired noise. The proposed system separates noises by using microphone
arrays as reference microphones and the separated signals are used as the reference signals of the ANC system. In simulation results, the proposed system
can improve the noise reduction performance in case where the ANC system uses two reference microphones and the reference microphones do not need to
be arranged close to the noise sources.

simultaneously. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed AEC can achieve higher ERLE and faster convergence than the conventional AEC. The
computational complexity of the proposed AEC can be reduced by reducing the number of taps of the sub-adaptive filter.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the introduction of a frequency domain variable perturbation control and a leaky algorithm to the frequency domain
time difference simultaneous perturbation (FDTDSP) method in order to improve the cancellation performance and the stability of the active noise control
(ANC) system using the perturbation method. Since the ANC system using the perturbation method does not need the secondary path model, it has an
advantage of being able to track the secondary path changes. However, the conventional perturbation method has the problem that the cancellation
performance deteriorates over the entire frequency band when the frequency response of the secondary path has dips because the magnitude of the
perturbation is controlled in the time domain. Moreover, the stability of this method also deteriorates in consequence of the dips. On the other hand, the
proposed method can improve the cancellation performance by providing the appropriate magnitude of the perturbation over the entire frequency band
and stabilizing the system operation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: In this paper, a method using a subadaptive filter playing the supplementary role of acoustic echo cancellation is discussed. Since the updating
state of the adaptive filter can be calculated approximately as a characteristic of the subadaptive filter, the step size parameter can be optimally controlled
depending on the estimation accuracy. Also, for prevention of echo path variation, we discuss a variable detector in which the variation of the filter
coefficients at the time of variation is considered. The proposed method is found to be robust to channel variations and can improve the ERLE by 10 to 15 dB
in comparison with the conventional method. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Electron Comm Jpn Pt 3, 90(2): 9-21, 2007;

Title: Multichannel feedforward active noise control system combined with noise source separation by microphone arrays
Author(s): Iwai, K (Iwai, Kenta); Kinoshita, S (Kinoshita, Satoshi); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Source: JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION  Volume: 453  Pages: 151-173  DOI: 10.1016/j.jsv.2019.04.016  Published: AUG 4 2019  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multichannel active noise control (ANC) system combined with noise source separation by microphone arrays. A
multichannel feedforward ANC system uses multiple reference microphones located close to noise sources and can reduce various acoustic noises such as
broadband noise. In general, it is difficult to place the reference microphones close to the noise sources owing to physical constraints. In this case, the
reference signals, which are the outputs of reference microphones, are highly correlated with each other, the noise reduction performance of the
multichannel ANC system is degraded. In other words, the reference microphones detect the highly correlated noises, reducing the noise reduction ability of
the ANC system. To solve this problem, a multichannel feedforward ANC system with a noise source separation technique is proposed. This system uses
microphone arrays located at the reference microphone positions. The mixed signal is separated from the target noise and other components by noise
source separation and the separated signals are used to update the noise control filters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ANC system can
separate the target noise and the disturbance noise and effectively reduce the target noise. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: We analyze the behaviors of the FXLMS algorithm using a statistical-mechanical method. The cross-correlation between a primary path and an
adaptive filter and the autocorrelation of the adaptive filter are treated as macroscopic variables. We obtain simultaneous differential equations that
describe the dynamical behaviors of the macroscopic variables under the condition that the tapped-delay line is sufficiently long. The obtained equations
are deterministic and closed-form. We analytically solve the equations to obtain the correlations and finally compute the mean-square error. The obtained
theory can quantitatively predict the behaviors of computer simulations including the cases of both not only white but also nonwhite reference signals. The
theory also gives the upper limit of the step size in the FXLMS algorithm.

Title: Multichannel Feedforward Active Noise Control System with Optimal Reference Microphone SelectorBased on Time Difference of Arrival
Author(s): Iwai, K (Iwai, Kenta); Hase, S (Hase, Satoru); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Source: APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL  Volume: 8  Issue: 11  Article Number: 2291  DOI: 10.3390/app8112291  Published: NOV 2018  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multichannel active noise control (ANC) system with an optimal reference microphone selector based on the time
difference of arrival (TDOA). A multichannel feedforward ANC system using upstream reference signals can reduce various noises such as broadband noise by
arranging reference microphones close to noise sources. However, the noise reduction performance of an ANC system degrades when the noise environment
changes, such as the arrival direction. This is because some reference microphones do not satisfy the causality constraint that the unwanted noise
propagates to the control point faster than the anti-noise used to cancel the unwanted noise. To solve this problem, we propose a multichannel ANC system
with an optimal reference microphone selector. This selector chooses the reference microphones that satisfy the causality constraint based on the TDOA.
Some experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can choose the optimal reference microphones and effectively reduce unwanted acoustic
noise.

Title: Modified second-order nonlinear infinite impulse response (IIR) filter for equalizing frequency response and compensating nonlinear distortions of
electrodynamic loudspeaker
Author(s): Iwai, K (Iwai, Kenta); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)
Source: APPLIED ACOUSTICS  Volume: 132  Pages: 202-209  DOI: 10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.11.014  Published: MAR 2018  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a modified second-order nonlinear infinite impulse response (IIR) filter for equalizing the frequency response and
compensating nonlinear distortions of an electrodynamic loudspeaker. A problem of electrodynamic loudspeakers is the generation of nonlinear distortions,
which degrade the sound quality. One of the approaches to reducing nonlinear distortions is to use a second-order nonlinear IIR filter. This filter is based on
an equivalent circuit model of an electrodynamic loudspeaker and its coefficients are determined by physical parameters. However, it is difficult to
compensate nonlinear distortions when a loudspeaker has a high Q factor at the lowest resonance frequency, at which the displacement of the diaphragm
and nonlinear distortions become large. The Q factor determines the linear frequency response of the electrodynamic loudspeaker. Although it is necessary
to compensate the Q factor of the loudspeaker, a nonlinear IIR filter cannot compensate the Q factor because it does not have a linear filtering feature. In this
paper, we propose a modified second-order nonlinear IIR filter that can not only compensate the nonlinear distortions caused by the nonlinearities of the
force factor and stiffness but also equalize the frequency response by employing the linear characteristics of the loudspeaker with the desired Q factor.
Experimental results show that the proposed filter can compensate the linear and nonlinear distortions more effectively than a conventional filter.

Abstract: An appropriate acoustic structure with a desired frequency response is rarely obtained through the acoustic equivalent circuit analysis in the case
of compact acoustic devices. Thus, skilled acoustic engineers must design structures based on their know-how, and the time and cost are increased.
Therefore, we propose an automatic design support system for compact acoustic devices introducing deep neural network. In the proposed system, the
acoustic characteristics of candidate structures are analyzed by the acoustic FDTD method and an optimal candidate is obtained by learned deep neural
network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system through some comparisons between desired and designed frequency responses.

Abstract: In the implementation of a multi-channel feedforward active noise control (ANC) system, the standard FxLMS algorithm demands too much
computational power to be real-time processed by a low-cost digital processor. Therefore, various algorithms have been proposed to reduce their
computational complexity by modifying the cost function and introducing the partial update (P-U). This paper proposes a new P-U minimax algorithm, which
minimizes the uniform-norm instead of the 2-norm of the error signals and updates the filtered reference signals partially. The P-U minimax algorithm is
compared with existing algorithms based on an experimental setup of a case (1, 4, 8) ANC system. The proposed P-U minimax algorithm is validated to be
efficient and outperform the scanning error and mixed-error algorithms with the same degree of computational complexity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an automatic speech translation system that selects its target language on the basis of the direction-of-arrival (DOA)
information. The system uses two microphones to detect speech signals arriving from specific directions. The target language for speech recognition is
selected on the basis of the DOA. Both the speech detection and target language selection relieves users from operations normally required for individual
utterances, without serious increase in computational costs. In a speech-recognition evaluation of the proposed system, 80% word accuracy was achieved
for utterances recorded with two microphones that were 40cm distant from speaker positions. This accuracy is nearly equivalent to that in which the time
frame and target language of a user's speech are given in advance.

Title: Compensation for Nonlinear Distortion of the Frequency Modulation-Based Parametric Array Loudspeaker
Author(s): Hatano, Y (Hatano, Yuta); Shi, C (Shi, Chuang); Kajikawa, Y (Kajikawa, Yoshinobu)

10.1109/TASLP.2017.2705280  Published: AUG 2017  
Abstract: The parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) modulates the audio signal on an ultrasonic carrier. When the modulated signal is transmitted in air, an
audio beam is created based on the nonlinear acoustic principle. Each modulation method has advantages and disadvantages. The frequency modulation
(FM) is favorable for its low cost and high volume, but the tradeoff is its complicated nonlinear distortion, which is difficult to be reduced. In this paper, the
Volterra filter is adopted to model the nonlinearity of the FM-based PAL. A novel complex inverse system is devised to effectively reduce the nonlinear
distortion. Three practical aspects are addressed. First, the computational complexity of the Volterra filter is reduced by the parallel cascade structure with
almost no compromise to the model accuracy. Second, Volterra filters are identified at discrete input levels to treat the nonlinearity that keeps changing with
the time-varying audio input. Third, when the input level is high, a separation approach is proposed to refine the identified Volterra filters, which eventually
improves the performance of the proposed inverse system.

Abstract: We analyze the behaviors of the least-mean-square algorithm for a time-varying unknown system using a statistical-mechanical method. Cross-
correlations between the elements of a primary path and those of an adaptive filter and autocorrelations of the elements of the adaptive filter are treated as
macroscopic variables. We obtain simultaneous differential equations that describe the dynamical behaviors of the macroscopic variables under conditions
in which the tapped delay line is sufficiently long. We analytically show the existence of an optimal step size. This result is supporting evidence of Widrow et
al.' s pioneering work that clarified the trade-off between the noise misadjustment and the lag misadjustment. Furthermore, we obtain the exact solution of
the optimal step size in the case of a white reference signal. The derived theory includes the behaviors for a time-constant unknown system as a special case.

Abstract: In the personal authentication using acoustic properties of ear canal (pinna related transfer function) by previous study, the high authentication
rate was obtained in the case of using the earphone and the headphone. On the other hand, in the case of using mobile phone, which does not cover the
outer ear or canal, the authentication rate is lower than that of other devices. However, the mobile phone does not require any other equipment for
measuring acoustic properties because micro speaker and microphone are built in. This is an important point for the highly convenient authentication
system using the pinna related transfer function. In this paper, the authors investigate authentication rate using the pinna related transfer function measured
by the mobile phone.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of headrest active noise control (ANC) system with the virtual sensing technique for factory noise. In
recent years, the development of various industrial devices has caused acoustic noise problems related to factory machines. Although the noise canceling
headphones and earphones can reduce factory noise, but they prevent verbal communications and give uncomfortable feeling, so headrest ANC systems
becomes one of candidates for this kind of situations. However, the headrest ANC system has a problem that the zone of quiet (ZoQ) cannot be formed
around desired locations (e.g. ears) because the ZoQ is generally formed around error microphones located into the headrest which are far from the desired
locations. Therefore, we have developed a headrest ANC system with virtual sensing technique. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the
proposed headrest ANC system through real world experiments. As a result, it is found that the proposed headrest ANC system can reduce unwanted factory
noise more than 30 dB at the desired locations compared with the conventional system (without virtual sensing technique).

Title: Modification of Second-Order Nonlinear IIR Filter for Compensating Linear and Nonlinear Distortions of Electrodynamic Loudspeaker

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a modified 2nd-order nonlinear IIR filter for compensation of both linear and nonlinear distortions of electrodynamic
loudspeakers. A nonlinear IIR filter is a nonlinear compensator and is based on a physical nonlinear model of electrodynamic loudspeakers. However, it is
difficult to compensate nonlinear distortions when a loudspeaker has large sharpness at the lowest resonance frequency, at which the displacement of the
diaphragm becomes large. Although it is necessary to compensate the sharpness of the loudspeaker, the nonlinear IIR filter cannot compensate the
sharpness because it does not have a linear filtering feature. In this paper, we propose a modified 2nd-order nonlinear IIR filter that can compensate not only
the nonlinear distortions but also the sharpness by employing the linear characteristics of the loudspeaker with the desired sharpness. Experimental results
show that the proposed filter can compensate the linear and nonlinear distortions more effectively than a conventional filter.

proposed realization of subband adaptive Volterra filter is applied to the identification of electro-dynamic loudspeaker systems and the effectiveness is
demonstrated through some simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed realization can significantly improve the estimation accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of an active noise control (ANC) system with period aware linear prediction (PALP) method and
simplified PALP (SPALP) method for MR noise. The PALP method expanding ordinary linear prediction method using delayed signal has high prediction
accuracy for periodic signal. We have attempted to apply the ANC system with the PALP method for reducing MR noise which has high periodicity. However
PALP method requires two adaptive filters and delay device. Thus the PALP method requires large memory size and computational complexity. For this
reason, we simplify the PALP method by removing one adaptive filter with undelayed signal. Simulation results demonstrate that the feedback ANC system
with the SPALP method has the same noise reduction performance as the PALP method while saving the computational complexity.
