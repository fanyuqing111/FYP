Dr. Leung was born in Hong Kong, and completed his first degree at the City University, 
London in 1976, graduating with first class honours. He then obtained his doctorate degree in 
1981 at the same university. His Ph.D. thesis was in electromagnetic analysis in linear motors 
in High Speed Ground Transport applications, under the supervision of the research team led 
by Professor Arthur J Ellison. Professor Ellison was renowned in his research in 
electromagnetic field analysis in electrical motors as well as in psychic and paranormal 
phenomena; Dr. Leung has been greatly influenced by Professor Ellison's interest in these 2 
areas. Dr. Leung joined CHAM Ltd. a computer consultancy firm headed by Professor 
Spalding of Imperial College, University of London, as project Engineer in 1981. He was 
responsible for the programme development of a general-purpose 3D-field solution computer 
programme. In 1982, he joined the Engineering Division of ERA Technology Ltd., as Senior 
Engineer and was responsible for various research projects funded by industry. 
He joined The Engineering Science Division of Hirst Research Centre, GEC Research Co. 
Ltd. as Principal Engineer, in March 1984, and was responsible for leading a project on the 
development of electromagnetic launchers for armour-piercing applications. In 1985 he 
joined the Weapon Department of Thorn EMI Electronics Ltd., and was responsible for the 
development of the Radar tracking of the multi-launch rocker system. In 1988, Dr. Leung 
moved to the USA joining Martin Marietta Aerospace in Orlando, working on the same 
system. In 1988 Dr. Leung joined the City University of Hong Kong as Senior Lecturer, and 
at present he is an Associate Professor in the Electronic Engineering Department, and team 
members of the Applied Electromagnetics Laboratory. His research interests has been in 
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), including  Human safety on RF exposure, EMC in 
Fixed Installations and Large Systems, EMC Management, and EMC in Railway Systems. 
Dr. Leung is actively involved in numerous consultancy projects assisting industry, in both 
Hong Kong and overseas,  in solving EMC/EMI problems; he is a Director of 
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Consulting Group of CityU Professional Services Ltd, 
City University of Hong Kong. He is Programme Leader of the Master of Science in 

-----
Electronic and Information Engineering Programme (MScEIE) of City University of Hong 
Kong. 
Dr. Leung is also the Authorized Representative and Technical manager to the calibration of 
Antennas for radiated Measurement of antenna factors  in accordance with ANSI C63.5-2006, 
and the EMC Test facilities of the City University of Hong Kong. He is also Assessor of the 
Hong Kong Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (HoKLAS) on EMC area, and a member of the 
working party on Electrical and Electronic Products, Accreditation Advisory Board, 
Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC), Government of Hong Kong SAR. 
Dr. Leung is also the founding Chairman of EMC  Hong Kong Chapter, of IEEE Hong Kong 
Section.
