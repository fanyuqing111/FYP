Biography 
Professor Z.Y. (Joe) Dong is a Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and 
Telecommunications, UNSW. He was the Head of School of Electrical and Information Engineering 
in the University of Sydney, and a contractor with Ausgrid and EPRI, USA. He is now a member of 
the ARC College of Experts. Prior to joining the University of New South Wales in 2017, he was 
Ausgrid Chair and Director of Ausgrid Centre of Excellence for Intelligent Electricity Networks (CIEN) 
at the University of Newcastle, Australia. He has also worked for Hong Kong Polytechnic University 
and as system planning manager with TASnetworks, Australia. Professor Dong's research interest 
includes power system planning and stability, smart grid/micro-grid, load modeling, renewable energy 
grid connection, electricity market, data mining, big data analytics, artificial intelligence and 
computational methods. He has served editor for a number of international top journals such IEEE 
Transactions on Smart Grid, IEEE PES Letters, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, IET

-----
Professor Dong has been the principle investigator for over 10 EPRI projects, 14 ARC grants, 4 grants 
under HK RGC & ITF scheme, and partner investigator of 2 theme based projects in Hong Kong. He 
has many industrial R&D and consulting projects in power system planning, stability, smart grid, 
electricity market analysis, load modelling and data mining based methods for energy system data 
analytics. As a consultant, he leads the development of the load models for Western Power 
Corporation's daily usage in operations and planning of Western Australia's transmission network. He 
lead the gas and electricity network co-planning for the $12.6m CSIRO Future Grid project. He also 
worked with government on smart grid cyber security. He is a member of IEEE taskforce on power 
system cascading failure, a chapter coordinator for CIGRE work group on load modelling, a core 
member of the IEEE PES Smart Building, Loads and Customer System Committee coordinating IEEE 
standards in Load Model and Simulation. He is the Deputy Chair for Smart Grid Australia (SGA) study 
group and leads its research domain on cyber physical systems, including representing SGA at the 
International Federation of Smart Grid. He established a team of 28 at Ausgrid Centre for Intelligent 
Electricity Networks to provide R&D support for the $100m (plus $500m from Ausgrid) Smart Grid, 
Smart City national demonstration project. 
 
Professor Dong obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Sydney in 1999. He has published over 300 
journal papers (mostly IEEE transactions and IET journals), and received over $16 million in research 
and industrial grants. Professor Dong has supervised or co-supervised over 50 PhD students, many 
who now work in industry and research/academia in Australia, Europe, Asia and America.
