About
Patrick Reynaert was born in Wilrijk, Belgium, in 1976. 
He received the Master of Industrial Sciences in Electronics 
(ing.) from the Karel de Grote Hogeschool, Antwerpen, 
Belgium in 1998 and both the Master of Electrical Engineering 
(ir.) and the Ph.D. in Engineering Science (dr.) from the 
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), Belgium in 2001 
and 2006 respectively.
From 2001 to 2006, he was a Teaching and Research 
Assistant within the MICAS research group of the Department of Electrical 
Engineering (ESAT), KU Leuven, Belgium. While working towards his Ph.D. 
degree, his main research focus was on CMOS RF power amplifiers and analog 
circuit design for mobile and wireless communications. From 2001 to 2006, he 
was also a Lector at ACE-Group T Leuven, Belgium where he taught several 
undergraduate courses on electronic circuit design. 
During 2006-2007, he was a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of the University of California at 
Berkeley. At the Berkeley Wireless Research Center, he was working on mm-
wave CMOS integrated circuits within the group of Prof. Ali Niknejad. For this 
research, he received a Francqui Foundation fellowship from Belgian American 
Educational Foundation (BAEF). During the summer of 2007, he was a visiting 
researcher at Infineon, Villach, Austria where he worked on the linearization of 
basestation power amplifiers. 
Since October 2007, he is a Professor (hoogleraar) at KU Leuven, Department of 
Electrical Engineering (ESAT) and a staff member of the MICAS research group. 
Since 2018, he is also a Guest Professor at the Southeast University in Nanjing, 
China. His main research interests include line-drivers and power amplifiers in 
CMOS, SOI, GaAs and GaN, mm-wave and THz circuits for communication and 
sensing and polymer microwave fibers. Prof. Patrick Reynaert gives lectures 
worldwide on power amplifiers and mm-wave chip design. 
Patrick Reynaert is a Senior Member of the IEEE and chair of the IEEE SSCS 
Benelux Chapter. He serves or has served on the technical program committees

of several international conferences including ISSCC, RFIC, IEDM, ESSCIRC, 
ICECS and PRIME. He has served as Associate Editor for TCAS-I and as Guest 
Editor for JSSC. 
He received the 2011 TSMC - Europractice Innovation Award and the 2014 Bell 
Labs Prize. 
Based on his research on mm-wave circuits, he founded two start-up companies: 
HAMMER-IMS in 2016, and Tusk-IC in 2018. He also serves on the board of 
directors of both companies.
