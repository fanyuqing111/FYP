PROFILE SUMMARY
Hybrid/electric vehicles, wind and solar power generation, fuel cells, more electric aircraft and 
ships ... . We are in exciting times where there are great opportunities for research to advance many 
emerging technologies as related to power conversion, distribution, utilization and generation. 
Cutting edge research is needed in these areas for achieving lower weight and volume, lower 
vibration, lower acoustic and electromagnetic noise, higher reliability, higher efficiency, and 
feasibility, scalability and adaptability of new technological breakthroughs in these areas.
My research interests encompass analysis, modeling, simulation, and prototyping of various existing 
or newly conceived electrical machines, drives, and power electronic circuits to achieve better 
weight and volume, better efficiency and better power density. To this end, my current research 
involves characterization and reduction of losses in electric machines, reducing power losses in 
power electronic circuitries, and achieving robust control topologies for steady state and transient 
performance. I have special interest in adaptation of new materials, topologies, and techniques for 
electrical machine design and power electronics to further the research. The research results are 
targeted to benefit renewable energy, hybrid/electric vehicles, aerospace and naval applications.
