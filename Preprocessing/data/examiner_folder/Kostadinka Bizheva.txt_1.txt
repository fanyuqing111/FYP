Dr. Bizheva's research focuses on the development of novel optical imag-
ing technology (Optical Coherence Tomography - OCT) that can be used 
in clinics to image various part of the human body for diagnostic purpos-
es or for monitoring the outcome of drug therapy or surgery.
Imaging with the OCT technology is non-contact, non-invasive and some of its medical applications in-
clude the diagnosis of potentially blinding diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy or macular de-
generation, screening for skin or oral cancer, or monitoring of surgical procedures such as retinal, corneal, 
heart and brain surgery.
Compared to commercially available OCT systems, the OCT technology developed in Dr. Bizheva's lab pro-
vides ultrahigh resolution in biological tissue sufficient to observe its cellular structure and the smallest 
blood vessels. Dr. Bizheva's research group has extensive and successful collaborations with Canadian and 
international industrial partners, as well as clinical collaborators with multiple hospitals in the Greater To-
ronto Area.

Dr. Bizheva's primary research contributions include: a) technological development of ultrahigh reso-
lution OCT (UHROCT) to allow for imaging of sub-cellular details in living biological tissue; b) novel 
biomedical applications of UHROCT, for example in ophthalmology and neuroscience; c) computer 
modeling of light interaction with biological cells; and d) image processing algorithms for UHROCT. 
In the past 5 years Dr. Bizheva has built a laboratory with a number of state-of-the-art UHROCT sys-
tems, established collaborations with research groups at UW and other Canadian universities and 
clinics, as well as many companies, manufacturing OCT systems or related equipment.
