Roman Genov received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Rochester 
Institute of Technology, NY in 1996 and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical 
and Computer Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD in 1998 
and 2003 respectively.   
Prof. Genov held engineering positions at Atmel Corporation, Columbia, MD in 1995 
and Xerox Corporation, Rochester, NY in 1996. He was a visiting researcher in the 
Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), 
Lausanne, Switzerland in 1998 and in the Center for Biological and Computational 
Learning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA in 1999. He has 
been on faculty of The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer 
Engineering at the University of Toronto since 2002.  
 Prof. Genov’s research interests include analog and digital VLSI circuits, systems 
and algorithms for energy-efficient signal processing with applications to electrical, 
chemical and photonic sensory information acquisition, biosensor arrays, neural 
interfaces, parallel signal processing, adaptive computing for pattern recognition, 
and implantable and wearable biomedical electronics.
