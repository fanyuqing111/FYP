Significant Professional Projects
2010 – : Ginseng – resource allocation in cloud servers. Ginseng is an implementation of a negoti-
ation agent using which elastic applications and services will be able to take part in auctions for
resources in cloud servers hosting multiple guests. Ginseng uses and implements game theoretic ideas
to encourage the guests to bid truthfully, and to make the resulting allocation of resources maximize
system utilization and owner’s revenue.
2003 – 2008: Gozal – realizing dependable grids. Gozal is a collaboration with the Condor team from
Madison, Wisconsin. Condor is one of the most popular grid batch systems in use today, with a world-
wide installation base of thousands resource pools. The Gozal team has developed a high availability
(HA) library for mission-critical grid services, and for Condor’s matchmaker and submission queues in
particular.
The special characteristics of the grid environment make the building of highly available services
unusually difficult.
The Gozal approach is unique in providing HA functionality itself as a set of
configurable services, which can be used by transparently decorating, but not changing, the original
services.
Gozal HA is used by the Condor matchmaker without changing even a single line of Condor soft-
ware code. Effective as of version 6.8, the Gozal software is incorporated into the standard Condor
distribution, which is used by thousands large-scale high-throughput Condor installations worldwide.
2000 – 2008: cJVM and JavaSplit – transparent distributed run-time for Java. The cJVM project
was originally carried out at IBM’s Haifa Research Laboratory, with the goal of transparently executing
multithreaded programs in parallel on distributed clusters. The cJVM project won several best paper
awards.
A follow-up project, called JavaSplit, was initiated at the Technion in collaboration with IBM. JavaS-
plit goals go beyond those of cJVM while exploiting a different set of technologies. In addition to
cJVM’s transparency, JavaSplit also achieves portability by using bytecode-level instrumentation and
distributed shared memory. Various optimization techniques are implemented for improved perfor-
mance. However, JavaSplit’s most unique property is high availability (HA), which is efficiently ob-
tained through novel replication protocols that extend the underlying memory model. Furthermore,
JavaSplit employs a novel speculation mechanism which is based on the HA rollback capabilities. This
mechanism boosts overall system performance, effectively nullifying the overhead of the HA protocols.
2005 – 2008: GridLogMiner – mining to improve large distributed systems. The GridLogMiner project
uses distributed data mining to improve large-scale grid batch systems. Mining job execution logs for
thousands of resources can improve user experience with the system, better match jobs to resources,
and help identify sources of malfunctions of all kinds. Moreover, resource misbehaviors such as black
and white holes can be pinpointed, while job misbehaviors such as attacks on resources and DDOS
attacks can also be detected and avoided.
In GridLogMiner, the execution logs at every resource are collected into local databases and transformed
into a system-independent representation using a specialized batch system ontology. The data is then
mined using a centralized control, whereas the queries to the local databases are piggybacked on the
underlying batch system mechanism itself. The GridLogMiner implementation can be downloaded as
an add-on to the Condor batch system.
The GridLogMiner ideas were taken up by Intel, resulting in an Intel-internal $3M project to collect
and mine the logs of NetBatch, Intel’s global batch system.
2004 – 2007: DataMiningGrid – data mining in grid environments. This EC funded project de-
velops tools and services for deploying highly demanding data mining tasks on grid environments.
The DataMiningGrid architecture employs a high-level workflow editor that utilizes Web services for
mining functionality and utilizes grid services for resource allocation and data movement. At the same
time. this architecture places a special emphasis on maintaining data privacy. To demonstrate the
16

-----
developed technology, the DataMiningGrid project implements a range of demonstrator applications
in e-science and e-business, including parallel and scalable mining of large, distributed datasets.
2006 – 2009: QosCosGrid – quasi-opportunistic supercomputing. The goal of this EC funded project,
is to develop core grid infrastructure capable of providing quasi-opportunistic supercomputing (QOS)
grid services and technology. It will enable users to develop applications with supercomputing re-
quirements without having to actually purchase and deploy supercomputers.
The technology will
be validated in the areas of stellar dynamics and evolution, biochemistry, ecological evolution, gene
regulation networks, and business supply chains.
1996 – 2004: Millipede – fine-grain software distributed shared memory. The goal in the original
Millipede project was to develop a single system image environment for parallel programming on top of
non-dedicated distributed networks of Windows workstations. An early version of Millipede provided a
virtual parallel machine with a high-level interface, including software distributed shared memory (the
first ever SDSM using Windows). It presented novel optimization techniques such as multi-protocol
weak-consistency for shared variables. This work was the first to discuss, implement, and use page
and thread migration for adaptive load-sharing, dynamic avoidance of false-sharing, and ping-pong
situations. The system analyzed the communication pattern during run-time and – via dynamic page
and thread migration – remapped the work accordingly. An article on Millipede was published in
BYTE Magazine.
A later version of Millipede presented a high-performance software distributed shared memory (OSDI
1999). By employing special memory mappings it was able to demonstrate the first fine-grain page-
based SDSM. Millipede avoided false sharing by adapting the sharing granularity to the native object
granularity as declared by the application. The sharing granularity was dynamically adapted on-the-
fly according to an autonomic run-time optimization mechanism, the only one of its kind (best paper
award, IPDPS 2001).
A recent version of Millipede uses Infiniband interconnections and in-kernel
processing to reach high-performance with Linux OS (Hot Interconnects 2003). Another version of
Millipede is fully transparent at the binary level, using Windows OS.
2004 – 2011: SuperLink Online. Online System for Faster Multipoint Linkage Analysis via Parallel Ex-
ecution on Thousands of Personal Computers (in collaboration with Mark Silberstein, Danny Geiger
and Miron Livny). Computation of LOD scores is a valuable tool for mapping disease-susceptibility
genes in the study of Mendelian and other complex diseases. SuperLink Online is a distributed system
for the computation of multipoint LOD scores of large inbred pedigrees-a task which is often beyond
the capabilities of a single computer when there is extensive missing data. The system achieves high
performance via efficient parallelization, a state-of-the-art serial program, and the use of the idle cycles
of thousands of personal computers. The main algorithmic challenge has been to efficiently split a large
task for distributed execution in a highly dynamic, nondedicated, hierarchical running environment.
The system is available online, facilitating the performance of computationally intensive analyses with-
out the need to install software or maintain a complicated distributed environment. The system is now
used extensively by hundreds of collaborating medical centers around the world. Access to the sys-
tem’s main computational power-tens of thousands of PCs- is in collaboration with the Condor team in
Madison, WI, the European Commission EGEE-II (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE), OSG (Open Science
Grid), and a home-grown community grid comprising 100K registered home PCs (20K active ones).
A note on SuperLink Online was published in the Science Magazine (under NetWatch Best of the Web
in science. Science 19 May 2006: 977). Several magazine articles were published during 2008-9.
2003 – 2008: MultiRace – data race detection in multithreaded code. MultiRace employs a com-
bination of the vector clocks paradigm, special memory mapping configurations, and transparent in-
strumentation in order to detect data races on-the-fly. MultiRace imposes negligible overhead on most
programs and can thus be switched on even in production mode.
MultiRace is unique in its matching of the detection granularity to the native object granularity of the
tested program. Automatic granularity refinement takes place whenever an alarm is generated. If the
17

-----
alarm is determined false, automatic aggregation reduces the overhead. MultiRace uses the same log-
ging mechanism for the implementation of improved versions of two different detection algorithms, thus
improving coverage with no false positives. MultiRace can be used to detect races on any reasonable
memory model.
The MultiRace vector clocks algorithm was implemented in Intel’s ThreadChecker, which is one of the
most important debugging tools for multithreaded programs.
