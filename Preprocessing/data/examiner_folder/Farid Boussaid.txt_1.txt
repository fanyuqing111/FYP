Curriculum Vitae 
 
Research experience & expertise 
 
 
• Integrated Circuit design of single-chip smart sensors − Full-cycle development of mixed-
mode analog/digital circuit designs such as: (i) miniature CMOS cameras integrating on-chip 
early vision processing capabilities including dynamic range compression, edge detection, 
image enhancement, and real-time detection of human skin for subsequent face detection, 
gesture recognition, lip reading, monitoring driver's hypo-vigilance or tracking a person in a 
crowd. Developed prototypes were optimized for power consumption and silicon area; and (ii) 
bio-inspired electronic nose CMOS chip with an integrated gas recognition circuitry, which 
examines the pattern of relative excitations across the population of gas sensors and looks for a 
“match” within a library of spatio-temporal gas fingerprints. 
 
• Microelectronics Fabrication Technology − (i) Contribution to the development of 
European semiconductor industry standard 0.18µm CMOS process through the fabrication 
of high performance ultra-thin p+n junctions for ULSI PMOS transistors. This was carried out 
by investigating three crucial technological steps, namely a low-energy B+ implantation, a BF2
+ 
implantation and a germanium preamorphization of Si-substrates; (ii) fabrication of tin oxide 
SnO2 gas sensor arrays for electronic nose chips. A microhotplate heater was integrated with 
each sensor to enable adsorption at high temperature; and (iii) development of novel high-
resolution micropolarizer array fabrication technologies enabling the concept of a fully 
integrated polarization camera-on-chip. The developed technologies exploit the well-
controlled process of ultraviolet photolithography to define the orientation of the micropolarizer 
elements covering individual photosensitive pixels. In contrast, prior works exhibit poor yield 
because they all rely on the relatively complex process of selective etching, which is difficult to 
control at the micrometer-scale pixel pitch. 
 
• Signal and image processing − (i) Development of robust 3D object and face recognition 
algorithms for machine vision and robotics; (ii) Development of image restoration 
algorithms for paper-thin vision sensors modeled after the compound eye of insects. These 
biomimetic sensors are half a millimeter thick and can generate a high-resolution image from 
the simultaneous acquisition of a mosaic of low resolution images; (iii) Implementation of 
robust image processing algorithms based on shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks. 
This networks possess interesting adaptive characteristics akin to those of natural vision 
systems. (iv) Implementation of compressive sensing for CMOS cameras to enable the signal 
to be sampled (and simultaneously compressed) at a greatly reduced rate. The energy and 
computation consumption associated to sensor nodes can thus be dramatically reduced by 
shifting the computational cost of compressive sampling to the decoder in the base station; and 
(v) Development of bio-inspired gas recognition mimicking the key signal processing 
mechanisms occurring in the olfactory pathway. This approach constitutes a unique 
departure from the current practice of processing multivariate gas sensor array data through the 
direct application of computationally expensive statistical/pattern recognition techniques. 
 
• Semiconductor Characterization − Development of a novel high resolution method to 
determine the physical parameters of deep levels and interface states in semiconductors. 
The proposed method, named (MP-DLTS), exploits Matrix Pencil (MP) spectrum estimation to 
process the multi-exponential capacitance transients that arise in Deep Level Transient 
Spectroscopy (DLTS). This novel approach has been found to consistently extend the linear 
regions and resolve closely spaced activation energies on Arrhenius plots. Another important 
feature of the developed technique is that it does not require prior knowledge of the number of 
discrete electronically active traps.
