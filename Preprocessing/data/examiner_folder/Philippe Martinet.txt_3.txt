Dear Harwati, 
 
Please proceed with the current examiner, panel members and chairman.  I received the confirmation from my 
employer to ahead. 
 
Bests,

Dear Soner 
  
Status: 
a) External examiner 1 signed NDA completely 
b) Another External examiner 2 signed NDA only on his part but don’t want to get a witness to sign 
c) Internal examiner signed NDA completely 
d) Oral panel member and Chairman willing to be your examiner but declined to sign NDA. 
  
Do advise if we should change the External examiner 2, Oral panel member and Chairman? 
Or can we proceed with them not signing NDA. 
  
Thank you and best regards

Dear  Harwati, 
  
Thanks for the information. Can you please proceed with asking if the examiners can sign the NDA?  
The request is coming directly from my employer and the managing director of the company that I am working. 
  
Bests, 
Soner

Dear Soner 
  
At the moment I did not inform them that they are supposed to sign NDA.

Dear Harwati, 
  
Just to clarify,  the examiners were asked to sign the NDA and they refused or the ones that are found do not 
have NDA signed at the moment? 
  
Bests, 
Soner

Dear Soner and Prof Wang

We have got all examiners, however they did not sign NDA. 
Please advise.

Dear  TingFang, 
  
Hope that you are feeling better today. Thank you for the notification.  I understand that there will be a 
waiting process from my side. I know that I will and should not know who are the examiners.  My question is 
will there be a notification when the nomination process is complete? So that I can have a better 
understanding of what is the timeline for amendment and for the oral defence. 
  
Regarding the thesis format, noted with thanks. 
  
Bests, 
Soner

only when the nomination process is completed. 
  
Also do note that the uploaded thesis format in your uploaded thesis is not according to OAS format. Kindly 
ensure that the format is according to OAS format during hardbound thesis submission. You can refer to this 
link for the format.
