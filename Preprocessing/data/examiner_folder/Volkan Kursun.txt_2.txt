Biography
Volkan Kursun was born in Ankara, Turkey in 1974. He received the B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering 
from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey in 1999. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and 
Computer Engineering from the University of Rochester, New York, USA in 2001 and 2004, respectively. He performed 
research on mixed-signal thermal inkjet integrated circuits with Xerox Corporation, Webster, New York, USA in 2000. During 
the summers of 2001 and 2002, he was with Intel Microprocessor Research Laboratories, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA, where he 
was responsible for the modeling and design of high frequency monolithic power supplies. He served as a tenure-track 
assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA 
from August 2004 to August 2008. He also held visiting professor positions at the Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan, Southern 
University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China, and Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea in 2008, 2013, and 2015, 
respectively. He is currently a tenured associate professor of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong 
University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong. His research interests are in the areas of gigascale 2D and 3D systems-
on-chip integration with nanoscale devices and interconnect for energy-efficient and reliable computing. He has more than 
161 publications and 9 issued USA and China patents in the areas of low-power and high-performance integrated circuits 
and novel semiconductor devices for high-performance and energy-efficient computing. He is the author of the book Multi-
Voltage CMOS Circuit Design (John Wiley & Sons Ltd., August 2006). Dr. Kursun received the Best Paper Award â€“ First Place 
in the IEEE 26th International Conference on Microelectronics in 2014. He received the Institute of Electronics Engineers of 
Korea (IEEK) Systems-on-Chip Design Group Award in 2012. He is a member of the technical program and organizing 
committees of a number of IEEE and ACM conferences. He served as the Technical Program Committee Chair of the Asia 
Symposium on Quality Electronic Design in 2010 and 2011. Dr. Kursun served on the editorial boards of the IEEE 
Transactions on Circuits and Systems I, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II, Journal of Circuits, Systems, and 
Computers, and IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems from 2007 to 2010, 2005 to 2008, 2005 
to 2011, and 2007 to 2015, respectively. He currently serves on the editorial boards of the Microelectronics Journal and 
Journal of Low Power Electronics and Applications. Dr. Kursun is a Senior Member of IEEE.
