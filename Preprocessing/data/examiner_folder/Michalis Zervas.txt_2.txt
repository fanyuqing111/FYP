Michalis N. Zervas graduated from the Electrical Engineering
Department, University of Thessaloniki, Greece (1984) and
received his M.Sc. degree in Applied and Modern Optics (with
distinction) and PhD degree in Fibre Optics from the University of
Reading (1985) and University College London (1989), respectively.
He joined the Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of
Southampton in 1991 as a Research Fellow and promoted to
Research Lecturer in 1995 and Professor in Optical
Communications in 1999. His research activities include advanced
optical �bre ampli�er con�gurations, high power �bre lasers, �bre
DFB lasers, Bragg grating theory and devices, surface-plasmon
e�ects and devices, optical microresonators, and non-linear �bre
optics. He is a co-founder of Southampton Photonics Inc., a
University of Southampton spin-o� manufacturing high power
�bre lasers, were he currently serving as Chief Scientist. He has
authored/coauthored over 250 technical publications, about 30
patents/patent applications (of which 15 are granted) and has
served on various conference program committees. He was the
general program co-chair of the 1999 Optical Ampli�ers Meeting
(OSA) in Japan. He has given a number of invited talks and short
courses in �ber ampli�ers and �ber Bragg gratings at major
international conferences. He was a coeditor of the journal
\"Integrated and Fiber Optics\", special issue on Fibre Bragg
Gratings. In 1996 he shared the prestigious Metrology award from
the Confederation of British Industry for his work on grating
measuring systems for characterizing re�ection and dispersion
performance of �ber Bragg gratings. In 2006 he was �nalist for the
Royal Society of Engineering McRobert Award for the
development of high power industrial �bre lasers.
Prof Michalis Zervas is (or has formerly been) a�liated with Centre
for Innovative Manufacturing in Photonics, University of
Southampton, Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of
Southampton and University of Southampton.
