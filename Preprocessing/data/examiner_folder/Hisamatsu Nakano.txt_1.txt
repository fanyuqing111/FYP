Biography 
Professor Hisamatsu Nakano (IEEE Life Fellow) received the Dr. E. degree from Hosei 
University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1974. Since 1973, he has been a member of the faculty of Hosei 
University, where he is now a professor emeritus and a special-appointment researcher at the 
graduate school. His research topics include numerical methods for low- and high-frequency 
antennas and optical waveguides. Prof. Nakano received the IEEE Transactions on Antennas 
and Propagation “H. A. Wheeler Award” in 1994. He was also the recipient of the IEEE 
Antennas and Propagation Society “Chen-To Tai Distinguished Educator Award” in 2006 
and the recipient of “the Prize for Science and Technology from Japan’s Minister of 
Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology” in 2010.More recently, he received the 
2016 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society “Distinguished Achievement Award.” Prof. 
Nakano is an Associate Editor of several journals and magazines, such as Electromagnetics 
and the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine. He served as a member of the IEEE APS 
administrative committee (2000-2002) and a Region 10 Representative (2001-2010).
