Seemantini K. Nadkarni, PhD
Seemantini is an Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, and directs her laboratory at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at
Massachusetts General Hospital. She received her PhD in Medical Biophysics from the University of Western Ontario, Canada. Her
doctoral research focused on three-dimensional ultrasound approaches with applications in echocardiography and intracoronary
imaging. Following her doctoral work, she completed her post-doctoral fellowship as an NSERC scholar at the Wellman Center for
Photomedicine, where she continued her research on intracoronary imaging, and focused on exploring optical strategies to evaluate
tissue biomechanics and microstructure.
Research Interests
Seemantini Nadkarni’s research encompasses both fundamental and translational areas of research, primarily focused on the
invention and investigation of novel optical technologies for applications in Hematology, Cardiology, cancer research and in vitro
diagnostics. The research initiatives in the Nadkarni lab span the investigation of novel optical methods using multimodal approaches
to detect unstable plaque, the development of hand-held optical sensors for whole blood testing at the point-of-care and development
of new imaging strategies to quantify the micromechanical properties of the tumor extracellular matrix. In addition, the group is
developing optical approaches and endoscopic probes for intra-luminal imaging of soft tissue biomechanics for a variety of clinical
applications.
