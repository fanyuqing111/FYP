Highlight Achievements on Deep Learning 
 
DeepID team led by Xiaogang Wang and Xiaoou Tang achieved the highest face verification accuracy (99.47%) on 
the most well known face recognition benchmark Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), which was the first time to 
surpass human performance (99.20%) on this benchmark. 
 
 
The DeepID‐Net team led by Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang, Chen Chagne Loy and Xiaoou Tang participated in 
ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, one the most important grand challenges in 
vision, and ranked NO.2 in the object detection task (GoogLeNet was the winner) among 38 top vision groups [2]. 
This challenge requires detecting objects of 200 categories from 40,000 web images. DeepID‐Net significantly 
improved the mean Average Precision (mAP) from 22.6% (best result of ILSVRC 2013) to 40.7%. A few months 
later, DeepID‐Net largely enhanced the state‐of‐the‐art to 50.3% [3], outperforming GoogLeNet (43.9%).

 
The CUvideo team led by Wanli Ouyang and Xiaogang Wang participated in ILSVRC 2015 and won the challenge 
of object detection from video. They achieved the mAP of 67.8%, while the team in the second place only 
obtained the mAP of 35.9%. The challenge required detecting 30 object categories from one thousand videos 
and CUvideo won 28 out of them.
