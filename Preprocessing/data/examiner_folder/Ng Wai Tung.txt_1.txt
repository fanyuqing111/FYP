Current Research Direction 
Our research group is currently working in a wide spectrum of areas, enabling the integration of 
power devices to form single chip systems. Our group has worked extensive in the development 
of CMOS compatible HV fabrication processes for automotive and consumer applications in the 
40-100V range. We also has on-going collaboration with our industrial research partners to 
develop discrete and integrated power MOSFETs, silicon, GaN and SiGe based BiCMOS 
fabrication processes for smart power ICs and wireless applications, respectively. 
In the past few years, we have also focused in the design and implementation of VLSI power 
management circuits. This includes the demonstration of integrated soft-switching topology with 
predictive dead-time control and a practical DVS (Dynamic Voltage Scaling) system in 2004. 
We are also working on the integrated DC-DC converters with digital control. We were able to 
demonstrate an integrated DC-DC converter with dynamically adjustable power transistor size 
for power conversion efficiency optimization at ISPSD’06 for the first time. This work allowed 
our group to win best student paper award for the 3rd time at this conference. We also have 
activities in integrated digital Class D power audio amplifiers with distortion suppression 
feedback to achieve highly competitive performance. Currently, we are working on Class D 
audio amplifiers with GaN power transistors for the output stage. 
Given the fact that the nature of our work is mainly experimental based. This includes exploring 
the possibilities of adding new device modules such as RF power transistors and/or high voltage 
(HV) transistors to enhance the functional features of current CMOS/BiCMOS processes. It is 
very critical to collaborate with industrial partners. Our industrial collaborators are the key 
reasons that allow us to implement device and circuit ideas in non-standard CMOS fabrication 
processes with large die size. 
Power and thermal management is currently an intensely pursued field. In addition to integrated 
digitally controlled DC-DC converters for portable power applications, we are also working on 
fully digital and synthesizable on-chip temperature sensors for monitoring the thermal profile of 
large VLSI dies. Another emerging area of importance is the development of GaN on Silicon 
power transistors. Power GaN HEMTs have the potential advantages of lower on-resistance, 
higher breakdown voltage, higher speed and higher operating temperature. Our group is currently 
working closely with an industrial sponsor to develop driving techniques to fully exploit the 
capabilities of these devices without introducing unwanted switching losses and electromagnetic 
interference. 
The diagram below is a quick snap shot of the research activities in our group.

Administrative Experience 
Significant portion of my administrative experience began in 2005 when I took office as the 
Associate Chair of Undergraduate Studies at the Department of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering, reporting directly to the chair of the department. We are a sizable department with 
approximately 1400 undergraduate students and 75 full time faculty members. My administrative 
responsibilities include the delivery of a nation leading flexible ECE curriculum (where students 
are can choose their courses for 3rd and 4th year), CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation 
Board) accreditation, student affairs, academic curriculum and policies, teach assignment, the 
hiring of all stipend instructors and teaching assistance, management of our teaching 
laboratories, negotiation with other departments and Faculties on teaching resources. Frequent 
interactions with various administrative offices ranging from the Governing Council, Faculty 
Registrar to student clubs allowed me to become familiar with the operation of the University. 
The Associate Chair position is a three years limited term appointment. In 2008, I was re-
appointed with a 2nd three years term. This allowed me to continue with the smooth roll-out of 
our Undergraduate Program. Notability, our office has led the in-house development of an on-
line academic credit tracking system that allows individual students to verify whether if they are 
meeting program and accreditation requirement based on their course selection.  
The Associate Chair position has helped me to appreciate the importance of transparent 
administration, the enhancement of students’ learning experience, alumni relationship, and 
teaching. In fact, my own personal teaching evaluation has steady improved during my term of 
office. I will continue to serve as the Associate Chair until 06/2011. 
Since 2014, I am serving as the directory for the University of Toronto’s Nanofabrication Centre 
(TNFC), an open access research facility for both domestic and international researchers. My 
duties include the supervision of five technical staff and one administrative staff to maintain the 
daily operation of three cleanrooms at the university. In addition, I am responsible for balancing 
the budget between user fees, university support, research grants, salaries, repair and 
maintenance. 
My other notable administrative experience include volunteer service as the Vice Chair of the 
IEEE Toronto Section (2008-2011), past board of directors for Auto21 — a Networks Centres of 
Excellence in Canada (2006-2007), and long term member of organizing committees for various 
IEEE conferences such as EDSSC and ISPSD. In addition, serving on the Scientific Advisory 
Board for the VIRTUS IC Design Centre at NTU, Singapore gave me the opportunity to develop 
my ability to provide expert guidance and feedback to a large organization.
