Associate Professor
Biography
Dr. Qi is a leading expert in experimental quantum
communications. He is well known for his work in both
discrete-variable and continuous-variable Quantum
Key Distribution (QKD), including the first
demonstration of decoy-state QKD, the discovery and
implementation of the first successful attack (time-shift
attack) against commercial QKD, the proposal of one
of the first attacks on free-space QKD (the spatial-
mode attack), the proposal of QKD protocols based on
time and frequency coding, and the invention and
demonstration of measurement-device-independent
QKD. He has extensive experimental experience in
discrete-variable QKD, continuous-variable QKD and
quantum hacking.
