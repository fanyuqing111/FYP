Advanced VLSI Design and Test Laboratory 
  
The Advanced VLSI Design and Test Group is involved in a number of projects covering a large 
spectrum of Microarchitecture, Security, VLSI Design and Test Research. 
Computer Architecture: On a broad level, our research interests are in path finding for 
efficient, resilient, and reliable architectures for the multicore era. Today’s designs are being 
shaped by the challenges of highly scaled technologies: stability and long-term reliability of 
devices, power dissipation limits that require dynamic adaptation of processor to computing 
needs. Our research in this area focuses on how to leverage the hardware and software 
abstraction layers of today’s systems to tradeoff performance, power and reliability in 
multicores. Several of the low level details of hardware such as power, thermal, and faults are 

-----
tightly correlated to the hardware behavior, interactions within the system, and application 
behavior. The conventional approach to tackling such problems in hardware comes with 
additional costs and high design complexity. On the other hand, software based techniques are 
severely limited by observability and controllability into the hardware due to the strict 
abstraction layers of today’s systems. We propose multiple alternatives for dynamic adaptation 
of hardware. One such approach is based on a middleware call microvisor. The hardware 
provides the knobs and controls to monitor the low level details at a fine granular level, whereas, 
the microvisor manages actions for the threads running on the cores. Insulating management 
from the traditional software (including the operating system) enables a scalable, flexible and 
secure system level solution and allows the microvisor to evolve freely. Other alternatives 
include, dedicated controller for dynamic thread monitoring and rescheduling for both 
symmetric and asymmetric chip multiprocessors. We are also working on the design and 
evaluation of a novel hybrid NoCarchitecture which utilizes separate network topologies for real 
time and best effort traffic so as to achieve higher QoS while simplifying arbitration. 
Security: We have published a number of papers recently on Physically Unclonable Functions 
(PUF). Our current research focuses on PUF and True Random Number Generators (TRNG). 
PUF and TRNG circuits rely on underlying device characteristics to generate random response. 
However, they rely on different properties of underlying circuits. PUF circuits are used for chip 
authentication. Their responses must be reliable and repeatable, implying that PUF response 
should be invariant to environmental factors such as voltage and temperature disturbances, yet 
they must vary from one fabricated device to the other implying that they must rely on physical 
variations. However, the response of the PUF circuit must not be a simple linear transformation 
of the physical variations which makes them vulnerable to modeling attacks. If they rely on non-
linear transformation of physical variations, such transformations must be sufficiently complex 
to withstand modeling attacks. Even the verifier needs to be able to withstand cloning attacks. It 
must not send the same sequence of challenges for authentication, as the correct responses may 
be memorized by an attacker and used subsequently. Our PUF circuits rely on exploiting 
lithographic distortions while we design these circuits to be insensitive to voltage and 
temperature to improve uniqueness while also improving their reliability. Our research in 
security is expanding to include various forms of attacks and countermeasures. We are also 
exploring how to use/secure NVRAM for crypto applications. Stay tuned for publications in this 
area soon. 
VLSI CAD, Design Methodologies & Test: Our research in this area includes logic 
synthesis for emerging devices such as FinFETs, clocking and clock network design, 3D 
architectures, dynamic pattern generation for worst case power analysis, thermal simulation, 
lithography simulation, dual pattern lithography, optical proximity correction, lithographic 
error modeling, yield analysis, circuit reliability analysis, soft-error analysis, modeling of non-
rectangular transistors and 3D devices. We have also explored suitability of GPGPUs for CAD 
algorithms. We have recently published a number of low-cost solutions for improving online 
error detection, diagnosis and repair that achieve nearly 100% coverage at about 15% energy 
overhead. We have a rich publication record in this area.
