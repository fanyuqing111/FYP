Research Interests 
  
Yuan Ping Feng has been a faculty member of Department of Physics at the National University of 
Singapore (NUS) since 1990. He joined NUS following a 3 year postdoctoral stint at Purdue University. 
His research interest is in computational condensed matter & materials physics, focusing mainly on 
the understanding of fundamental properties of materials for advanced technologies, and prediction 
of new materials based on ab initio electronic structure calculations. In recent years, he has studied 
various materials including dilute magnetic semiconductors, graphene spintronics, high-k materials, 
topological insulators, semiconductor and metal surfaces and interfaces, materials for magnetic data 
storage, etc. He has an established track record in collaboration with experimentalists. He has 
authored/co-authored more than 500 scientific papers in international refereed journals and one 
book.
