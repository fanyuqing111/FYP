Dear Joy, 
  
  
Good afternoon ! 
  
My name is Li Kaiyuan. I have submitted my PhD thesis to NTU EEE on Sep. 30th, and I am one of the 
applicants for TD/173/15. 
  
As the inventors, Prof Tseng and me plan to NOT move forward on the Invention Disclosure TD/173/15, 
since the NDA issue might retard my PhD examination. 
  
  
Thank you very much and have a good day. 
  
  
Best regards, 
Kaiyuan

Dear Prof Soong, dear Kaiyuan, 
  
Thank you for your emails. 
  
Since TD/173/15 is kept as confidential information, kindly ask the external reviewers / examiners for your 
thesis examination and oral defense to sign an NDA. Further, please ensure that the thesis examination 
and oral defense are held in a “closed door” environment (i.e. restricted to the examiners and not open to 
public). Please also mark the documents presented during the thesis examination and oral defense as 
‘Confidential’. 
  
Please inform the EEE Graduate Programme Office that the sections related to TD/173/15 in the PhD thesis 
are kept as confidential information and thus, should be blanked out before the PhD thesis (both hard 
copy and digital copy) is made available in the library. 
  
Hope the above answers your queries. 
  
  
Regards, 
Joy

Dear Ms. Joy, 
  
  
My name is Li Kaiyuan, a PhD candidate in NTU EEE, and I am one of the applicant for TD/173/15. I am in 
the process of submitting my PhD thesis for examination.

Since I included a rough description of the technology disclosure TD/173/15 in my PhD thesis, after 
discussion with Prof Tseng King Jet and Prof Soong Boon Hee, we believed that an NDA was needed for, 
e.g., the thesis examination and the oral defense. 
  
We would like to report to EEE Graduate Prgramme Office that a technology disclosure was included in my 
PhD thesis thus an NDA is required, and proceed accordingly. 
  
May I get your advice for some additional essential steps before we report to EEE ? 
  
  
Thank you very much and have a good night. 
  
  
Best regards, 
Kaiyuan

Dear Ms. Joy 
I refer to the following TD173/15. I have taken over as PhD supervisor to his student Mr. Li Kaiyuan as Prof 
Tseng KJ has left NTU in Nov 2016 last year .  
  
Currently, Mr. Li Kaiyuan in the the process of submitting his PhD thesis for examination. I understand that 
some minor material to has been added to the his thesis. Can you kindly advise the two inventors on this issue? 
As I have not encountered such as case before. Can you let me know what would be future plan for this TD 
application and if from thesis examination stage, we would need to provide any additional steps for this. 
Thereafter, as his supervisor, I can inform our EEE  GPO accordingly. 
  
Thank you and have a nice day. 
  
Best Regards 
BH Soong 
  
Hi Harwati, 
This is what I understand from the student that he has filled an invention disclosure, you may find on pg. 207 of 
the thesis – it states  
  
Patents & Invention Disclosure 
  
K. Li, K.J. Tseng, “Fast charging LTO battery with high accuracy online SOC estimation”, submitted to NTUitive 
Pte Lte for patent application, under review as invention disclosures.

Dear Inventors, 
Title: Fast Charging LTO Battery with High Accuracy Online SOC Estimation 
Our Ref: TD/173/15 
We have reviewed the above captioned TD and have discussed it at our Patent Committee Meeting. After 
deliberation at the Meeting, we regret to inform that the Patent Committee has decided not to file a 
patent application for this invention. 
The reason for this decision is due to current verification only conducted on one brand of LTO battery. It is 
good to find out if other brands of LTO batteries will display the same characteristic for 
estimating/monitoring the state of charge. Therefore, at the present stage, the Patent Committee has 
decided to keep this invention as confidential information while providing you with more time to conduct 
experiments on the other brand/type of LTO batteries. It would also be good to verify if the characteristic 
is consistent throughout the battery lifetime cycle. 
Please keep us informed on any updates on the verification results and technology development of this 
invention. We will revisit this TD for patent filing consideration after receiving the updates from you. 
In the meantime, since we are keeping this invention as confidential information, please ensure that this 
invention is not published or disclosed in any other forms (e.g. oral, written, etc.). 
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries or require any clarification. 
Thank you. 
Regards, 
Joy
