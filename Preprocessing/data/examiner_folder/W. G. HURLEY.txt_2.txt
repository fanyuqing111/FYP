Biography 
Prof. Hurley was born in Cork, Ireland.  He received the B.E. degree with 1st class honours in Electrical Engineering from the
National University of Ireland, Cork in 1974.  In 1974 he was awarded the Irish ITT Fellowship to the U.S.A. and obtained the M.S.
degree in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge MA, in 1976.  He was awarded the PhD
degree at the National University of Ireland, Galway in 1988. He was awarded the higher doctorate D.Eng degree by the National
University of Ireland in 2011. 
He worked for Honeywell Controls and Ontario Hydro in Canada from 1977 to 1983 and in the University of Limerick, Ireland from
1983 to 1991. He is currently Professor of Electrical Engineering at the National University of Ireland, Galway.  He served as Dean of
Research from 2001 to 2004 and as Vice President for Strategic Initiatives and External Affairs from 2004 to 2008. He served on the
Udarás/Governing Body of NUI Galway from 2001 to 2005. He is the Founder/Director of the Power Electronics Research Centre at
NUI Galway.  He served on the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Visiting Professor of Electrical Engineering
in 1997/1998.  Prof. Hurley has given invited presentations in Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Spain, Czech Republic, Hong Kong,
