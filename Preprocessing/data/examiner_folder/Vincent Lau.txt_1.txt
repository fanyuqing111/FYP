Biography
Vincent obtained his BEng (Distinction 1st Hons – ranked 2nd) from the
department of EEE, University of Hong Kong in 1992. He joined the Hong
Kong Telecom (PCCW) after graduation for 3 years as project engineer
and later promoted to system engineer, responsible for transmission
systems design. He obtained the Sir Edward Youde Memorial Fellowship,
Rotoract Scholarship and the Croucher Foundation in 95 and went to the
University of Cambridge for PhD in mobile communications. He completed
the PhD degree in 2 years and joined the Lucent Technologies – Bell labs
as member of technical staff in 1997. In 1999 – 2001, 2003 – 2004, he
was with the department of EEE, University of Hong Kong where he left as
Associate Professor. During 2001 – 2003, he was on leave from the HKU
and joined the ASIC Design Group – Bell Labs – Lucent Technologies in
the US working on wideband CDMA base station ASIC Design and Post
3G Technologies. From 2003 to present, he is a technology consultant of
ASTRI, leading the "Advanced Technologies Team" of the Wireless
Access Group on wireless LAN infrastructure design. He joined the
department of ECE, HKUST as Associate Professor in August 2004. He
has a total of 7 years industrial experience and 4 years of academic
experience.
Vincent has published around 40 papers in IEEE Transactions, 60 papers
in IEEE conferences, 15 Bell Labs Technical Memorandum and
contributed to 12 US patents on wideband CDMA and wireless LAN
systems. He is the principal author of a book on MIMO adaptation
technologies [by John Wiley and Sons – John Proakis Telecom Series in
2005] and a book on wireless baseband System-on-Chip (SoC) ASIC
design [by Cambridge University Press in 2006] as well as invited author
of two book chapters on wideband CDMA technologies. He received two
best paper awards (IEE and HKIE) and was the invited session chair /
technical programme committee of the IEEE WCNC2000 international
conference, IEEE CAS 3G Workshop 2000, SCT2001 International
Conference, WOCC 2003, ICC 2003 as well as Globecom 2004. He is
currently an Editor of IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications as
well as a senior member of IEEE.
