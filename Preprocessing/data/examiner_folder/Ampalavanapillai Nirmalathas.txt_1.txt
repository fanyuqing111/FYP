BIOGRAPHY
Professor Thas (Ampalavanapillai) Nirmalathas 
Thas Nirmalathas is a Professor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He is also the Head of
Electronic and Photonic Systems Research Group at the Department of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering, The University of Melbourne.
Prof Nirmalathas obtained his BEng and PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the
University of Melbourne in 1993 and 1998 respectively. Between 2000 and 2004, he was the
Director of Photonics Research Laboratory (Melbourne Node of Australian Photonics CRC) and
also the Program Leader of Telecommunications Technologies Program. From 2004 to 2006, he
was the Program Leader for the Network Technologies Research Program in NICTA. He was also
the acting Lab Director of VRL in 2007. Between 2006 and 2008, He was the Research Group
Manager of the Networked Systems Group of Victoria Research Laboratory (VRL) at the National
ICT Australia (NICTA), a premier Australian research centre of excellence in ICT. Between 2010
and 2012, he was the Head, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University
of Melbourne. In  2012, he co-founded the Melbourne Accelerator Program (MAP
http://themap.co) to support the entrepreneurial activities of the University Community through
business acceleration methodologies and was the director of MAP until 2015. He was the Director
of Networked Society Institute between 2014 and 2019 and provided leadership to the institute.
Networked Society Institute was a catalyst in supporting interdisciplinary research tackling
societal challenges through exploration of connectivity between people, places and things.  
His research interests include microwave photonics, optical-wireless network integration,
broadband networks, and scalability of telecom and Internet services. 
He has serviced as chair of steering committees of Asia Pacific Microwave Photonics and IEEE
Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics Conference series in 2008/2009. He is also a member
of the Steering Committee for the International Conference on Optical Internet (COIN). He was
also Guest Editor for Special Issue on Opto-Electronics and Communications of the IEICE
Transactions in Communications. He was the General Co-Chair of 2008 IEEE Topical Meeting on
Microwave Photonics/ Asia Pacific Microwave Photonics 2008. He is currently an Associate Editor
of IEEE/OSA Journal of Lightwave Technology. He is a Senior Member of IEEE and the Optical
Society of America, and a Fellow of the Institution of Engineers Australia.
