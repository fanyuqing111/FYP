Design and control of a �ying parallel robot
Drone co-manipulation is already an explored �eld, especially in load transportation. Those co-manipulations are generally performed with cables, resulting
in a sort of �ying cable parallel robot. With such structure, the manipulation workspace is always situated under the drones. The main idea of this project is
to replace the cables by rigid bodies. With recon�guration techniques developed on classic parallel robots, it will be possible to manipulate an object und…

Elastostatic Modelling of a Wooden Parallel Robot
Eco-design of industrial robots is a �eld of research which has been rarely explored in the past. In order to considerably decrease the
environmental impact of robot during the design phase, metal or carbon composite parts can be replaced by bio-sourced materials, such as
wood. Indeed, wood has interesting mechanical properties, but its performance/dimensions will vary with the atmospheric conditions/external…

Ef�cient Decentralized Collaborative Mapping for Outdoor Environments
An ef�cient mapping in mobile robotics may involve the participation of several agents. In this context, this article presents a framework for
collaborative mapping applied to outdoor environments considering a decentralized approach. The mapping approach uses range measurements
from a 3D lidar moving in six degrees of freedom. For that case, each robot performs a local SLAM. The maps are then merged when…

This paper deals with a novel �ying mechanism. Inspired from parallel manipulators, this �ying robot is composed of three quadrotors linked by a
rigid articulated architecture composed of three legs and a platform. Associating quadrotor co-manipulation and rigid bodies, this new design
offers novel possibilities for aerial robotics and manipulation. Previous work leads to the design of a �ying parallel robot with two quadrotors.…

Dynamic Driving Task Fallback for an Automated Driving System whose Ability to Monitor the Driving Environment has been Compromised
An Automated Driving System (ADS) is subject to hazardous weather conditions and to failures, both of which can result in a partial or total loss
of its ability to monitor the driving environment. Yet until high driving automation and full driving automation is achieved, a human driver is
expected to respond appropriately to any malfunction or adverse on-road conditions preventing the ADS from reliably sustaining the dynamic…

Dynamic Modeling and Trajectory Tracking Controller of a Novel Flying Parallel Robot
This paper presents a new �ying robot, composed of two quadrotors linked by a rigid articulated passive chain. The robot obtained is similar to a
parallel robot where the classic actuators have been replaced by �ying drones. With its rigid structure presenting an internal degree of freedom,
the robot presented is a step forward in �ying robotics and presents new challenges for the design of its feedback control. In this paper the…

A Controller Avoiding Dynamic Model Degeneracy of Parallel Robots during Singularity Crossing
Parallel robots present singular con�gurations that divide the operational workspace into several aspects. It was proven that type 2 and leg
passive joint twist system (LPJTS) singularities can be crossed with a trajectory respecting a given dynamic criterion. However, the practical
implementation of a controller able to track such trajectories is up to now limited to restrictive cases of type 2 singularities crossing. Analyzing…

A Controller for Avoiding Dynamic Model Degeneracy of Parallel Robots During Type 2 Singularity Crossing
Parallel robots presents singular con�gurations that divide the operational workspace into several aspects. It was proven that such singularities
can be crossed under the constraint of a dynamic criterion. However, the practical implementation of a robust controller able to track such
trajectories is up to now limited to a more restrictive criterion By solving the inverse dynamic model in the singularity for the general case we
