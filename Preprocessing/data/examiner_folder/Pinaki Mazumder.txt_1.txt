IX. Professional Experience 
 
Details of My Professional Accomplishments  
 
US Government at National Science Foundation (3 years) 
 
In 2007 and 2008, I worked as the lead Program Director for Emerging Models and 
Technologies (EMT) program in the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations 
(having about $140 Million annual budget) of the Directorate for Computer and Information and 
Science and Engineering, National Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia. My mandate was to 
manage research grants in Nanoelectronic Modeling and Systems, Quantum Computing, and 
Biologically Inspired Computing for which I had an operating annual budget of about $18 Million. 
Additionally, I participated in several NSF cross-cutting programs such as Cyber-Enabled Discovery

6
and Innovation (CDI), Expeditions in Computing, Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), 
Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). In 2009, I worked as a 
Program Director in the Engineering Directorate where I managed research in three broad areas: 
Adaptive Intelligent Systems (Machine Learning), Quantum, Molecular and High-Performance 
Modeling, and Electronic and Photonic Devices. During these three years, I interacted with several 
program managers and administrators of NSF, DARPA, ARO, ONR, and AFOSR to help launch 
national-level major research initiatives. I consider that serving the US government for a stint of three 
years has provided me an exceptional opportunity to acquire a vast amount of knowledge in various 
fields of science and engineering, to network with numerous researchers around the nation, and to 
gain divergent administrative experience. 
 
Teaching Experience (24 years) 
 
Since 1988, I have been working as a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering 
and Computer Science of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
 
Graduate courses developed and taught: 1) VLSI System Design, 2) Optimization and 
Synthesis of VLSI Layout, 3) Testing of Digital Circuits and Systems, 4) Advanced Computer 
Architectures, 5) Nanocircuits and Nanoarchitectures, and 6) Ultra-Low-Power Subthreshold CMOS 
Circuits.  
 
Undergraduate courses upgraded and taught: 1) Introduction to Digital Logic Design 
(sophomore level), 2) Digital Integrated Circuit Design (junior level), and 3) VLSI System Design 
(senior level). 
 
Industrial Experience (6.5 years) 
 
After my baccalaureate degrees in Physics and Electrical Engineering, I worked for six years 
(1976-1982) as a Senior R&D Engineer at Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL) in its Integrated Circuits 
Division. I designed several bipolar and CMOS analog and digital integrated circuits for consumer 
electronic systems.  I was associated with the following chip development projects:  i) Raster-scan 
vertical deflection system microchip for TV display, ii) Sync processing and horizontal deflection 
system microchip for TV display, iii) Video and audio IF stage IC’s for vestigial-AM and FM signal 
detection in TV receiver, iv) High-gain audio amplifier microchip for TV audio stage, v) Tape 
Recorder IC with automatic gain adjustments, vi) Hearing-aid IC, vii) Analog clock driver IC, and 
viii) LCD and AC Plasma display drive IC’s. Several million commercial chips were fabricated based 
on these designs.  
 
After finishing my MSc degree in Computer Science and while working towards my PhD 
degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I worked during the summers of 1985 and 1986 as a 
Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories. I was one of the two engineers who started 
the Bell Laboratory Cones/Spruce project - a new behavioral synthesis and layout automation tool for 
rapid prototyping of digital circuits. The main contribution of this effort was to demonstrate how a 
restricted version of C language could be used to model digital hardware much before commercial 
hardware description language (HDL) software tools like Verilog and System C were designed.  
 
X. List of Courses Taken During M.Sc. (in CS) and Ph.D. (in CE) Study 
 
My BS degrees were in Physics Honors and Electrical Engineering, while my MSc and PhD degrees 
were in CS and CE, respectively. I took the following CS and CE courses while doing my MSc and 
PhD: 

-----

Architectures, 11) Minicomputer System Architecture, 12) VLSI Layout Automation and Circuit 
Simulation, 13) VLSI System Design, 14) AI Based CAD for VLSI, 15) Digital Testing and Fault 
Tolerance, and 16) Programming Languages.  
 
M.Sc. Thesis Title: Networks and Embedding Aspects of Cellular Structures for On-Chip 
Parallel Processing in VLSI, University of Alberta, Canada, 1985. Synopsis: The thesis 
presented an asymptotic model to estimate the area, delay, and reliability performance metrics of 
multi-core parallel processing VLSI chips. Through a comparative theoretical analysis, the thesis 
demonstrated that two-dimensional meshes and torus class of interconnect topologies are superior for 
on-chip parallel processing to more powerful interconnection topologies such as perfect shuffle 
networks, cube connected cycles, and X-trees which perform slowly due to dilatation of wires when 
mapped onto VLSI chips. The thesis provides a few algorithmic models to bind the dilatations of wire 
lengths to retain the square shape of processor layouts. Finally, the thesis introduced novel cellular 
embedding layout methodologies for multi-core parallel processors by applying the chromatic plane 
ornamentation theory. This theoretically motivated research was performed almost 20 years before 
the commercial adoption of VLSI multi-core processors that are now dominating the microprocessor 
market. The research work resulted in 3 archival journal papers, 3 conference papers, and a section 
(on asymptotic modeling of VLSI interconnect networks) in a textbook, titled Parallel Processing 
Architectures and VLSI Hardware, Prentice Hall, 1989 by A. L. De CeGama.  
 
NB: I also applied the theory of cellular embedding I developed in my MSc thesis to find planar and 
3-D topologies that can be recursively decomposed to yield quad-tree and oct-tree data structures in 
spatial data query processing for computer vision, tomography, cartography, and gridded image 
processing. 
 
Ph.D. Thesis Title: Testing and Fault-Tolerance Aspects of High-Density Random-Access 
Memory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1988. Synopsis:  The thesis introduced 
the “line-mode plurality testing technique” for high-density DRAM and CAM chips. Based on this 
design-for-testability approach, fast parallel testing algorithms were developed for testing a broad 
class of parametric and pattern-sensitive faults. The resulting test procedures are significantly more 
efficient than previous approaches due to test length optimization by applying the chromatic plane 
ornamentation theory. In many embedded memory applications where neither the input address and 
read/write lines are externally controllable nor are the output lines directly observable, the proposed 
algorithms can be adapted for implementing deterministic built-in self-test (BIST) circuits by 
designing the read/write sequences through Hamiltonian tours on the hypercube graph. Also, the 
thesis presented an extensive amount of Markov modeling and probabilistic analysis in order to 
determine the lengths of randomly applied test patterns for various classes of functional faults in 
scattered and small embedded memories where the proposed deterministic BIST technique cannot be 
incorporated. Finally, the thesis addressed the improvement of storage reliability by two to three 
orders of magnitude by introducing a new on-chip error correcting (ECC) technique capable of 
correcting the double-bit errors due to alpha particles striking between the 3-D vertically integrated 
trench DRAM cells. The thesis also analyzed the limitations of popular types of double-bit ECC 
techniques like the Projective Geometry Code in VLSI applications. The research resulted in 6 
archival journal papers, 6 conference papers, and several chapters in two books on semiconductor 
memories coauthored by me (see the Publications section).

NB: Even though when the thesis was written in 1987 the DRAM chip size was merely 256 Kilo bit 
and the proposed “line-mode plurality testing technique” was not necessary, the proposed method has 
been widely adopted by memory chip manufacturers in multi-Mega and Giga-bit DRAM chips in 
order to reduce the memory chip testing time by a significant margin (nearly a thousand times).

XVII. Extracurricular Activities 
 
I am an avid tennis player and have been playing the game for the past 30 years, whenever I am 
not injured. Some of my sports awards that perhaps I am more proud of than my professional 
achievements are listed below. Of course, I belong to the category of hackers who pay to play rather 
than get paid to play. So these awards are small consolations for my efforts in these games.  
Memorable moments in my tennis life: i) To be selected as a Line Umpire in an ATP tour 
(professional) tennis tournament, and to call “Foot fault” thrice in a quarter final match after giving 
warning to a pro player. ii) An abridged version of my article, entitled “Is Rafael Nadal an anomaly 
like Bjorn Borg?” was published in New York Times in 2011.  
 
 
Tennis: Between 1975 and 2002, won several prizes in Singles and Doubles Events (between 
4.0 and 4.5 NTRP levels) in Ann Arbor City Open Tennis Tournament, Ypsilanti (Michigan) 
City Open Tennis Tournament, Bangalore City Tennis Tournament, Indian Institute of 
Science Tennis Tournament, Bharat Electronics Ltd. Tennis Tournament, Huron Valley 
Tennis Club Tournament, etc.  
 
 
Badminton: Represented Indian Institute of Science in Karnataka State University 
Tournament and won the tournament in 1975 primarily due to the presence of Pradeep 
Padukone who is the brother of World Badminton Champion Prakash Padukone. Also won 3 
prizes in I.I.Sc. Intramural Tournaments. 
 
 
Table Tennis: Between 1974-1976, won 4 prizes in I.I.Sc. Intramural Tournaments.
