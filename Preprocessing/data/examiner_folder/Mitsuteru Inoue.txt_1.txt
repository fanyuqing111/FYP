Research
Our expertise is laid on the field of magnetics. Based upon the interaction among spins and other physical quantities such as light 
and sound, new class of functional materials and their applications are now under investigations.
Fabrication of magnetophtonic crystals with artificial periodic structures and elucidation of their linear and nonlinear optical 
properties, preparation of nano-structured magnetic materials, formation of electronic ceramics, are good examples of the studies in 
material development section of our group.
The application section of our group is now interested in the holographic optical data storage, optical switches with ultrahigh speed, 
three-dimensional display, ultra-fast spatial light modulators, and unwire SAW sensing systems.
These studies have been supported, in part, by JST-CREST, MEXT evolutional technology development project, NEDO nano-level 
electronic ceramics development project, and Grant-In-Aid from MEXT.
