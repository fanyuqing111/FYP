Stefano MARANO | Curriculum
Stefano Marano received the Laurea degree (summa cum laude) in Electronic Engineering and the 
Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, both from the University of 
Naples, Italy, in 1993 and 1997, respectively. Currently he is an Associate Professor at the 
University of Salerno, Italy, where he formerly served as Assistant Professor. He has held visiting 
positions at Physics Department, University of Wales, College of Cardiff, and at Department of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, in 1996 and 2013, 
respectively. His areas of interest include statistical signal processing with emphasis on distributed 
inference, sensor networks, and information theory. In these areas he has published more than one 
hundred and thirty papers, including some invited, on leading international journals/transactions 
and proceedings of leading international conferences, and he has given several invited talks. 
Stefano Marano was awarded the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND 
PROPAGATION 1999 Best Paper Award for his work on stochastic modeling of electromagnetic 
propagation in urban environments. He also co-authored the paper winning the Best Student Paper 
Award (2nd place) at the 12th Conference on Information Fusion in 2009. As a reviewer, he 
handled hundreds of papers, mainly for the IEEE TRANSACTIONS, and was selected as 
Appreciated Reviewer by the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING in the years 
2007 and 2008. Stefano Marano is in the Technical Committee of the major international 
conferences in the field of signal processing and data fusion, and recently served as Area Chair for 
EUSIPCO 2011, EUSIPCO 2013 and EUSIPCO 2015. He was in the Organizing Committee of 
the Ninth International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2006), and in the Organizing 
Committee of the 2008 IEEE Radar Conference (RADARCON 2008). He served as Associate 
Editor for the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING (2010-2014) and is currently 
serving (since 2009) as Associate Editor and Technical Editor for the IEEE TRANSACTIONS 
ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS.
