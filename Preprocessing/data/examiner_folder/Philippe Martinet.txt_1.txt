electronics science from the Blaise 
Pascal University, Clermont-Ferrand, 
France, in 1987.
From 1990 til 2000, he was assistant 
Professor with CUST in the Electrical 
Engineering 
Department, 
Clermont-
Ferrand. From 2000 until 2011, he has 
been a Professor with Institut Français 
de 
Mécanique 
Avancée 
(IFMA), 
Clermont-Ferrand. He was performing 
research at the Robotics and Vision 
Group of LASMEA-CNRS, Clermont-
Ferrand. In 2006, he spent one year as a 
visiting professor in ISRC at the 
Sungkyunkwan university in Suwon, 
South Korea.
He was the leader of the group GRAVIR 
(over 74 person) from 2001 til 2006. 
From 1997 until 2011, he led the Robotic 
and Autonomous Complex System team 
(over 20 persons). From 2008 until 2011, 
he co-lead a Joint Unit of Technology 
called “Robotization in meet Indutry”, 
and the Korea France Joint Research 
Center on Cognitive Personal Transport 
Service Robot in Suwon (South Korea).
In September 2011, he moves to Ecole 
Centrale de Nantes and make his 
research at IRCCYN in the robotics team.

Until 
2015, 
he 
stayed 
associated 
researcher 
to 
Pascal 
Institute 
in 
Clermont-Ferrand. Since 2017, IRCCyN 
becomes LS2N. He was deputy head of 
the ARMEN Team.
In November 2017, he moves to Inria 
Sophia Antipolis as Research director. 
Since 2018, he is the leader of the 
CHORALE team.
He was coordinator of the EMJMD 
EMARO+ from 2014 until 2016. Until 
2017, he was in charge of the robotics 
speciality in the ARIA master.
Since 2015, he is deputy head of the 
French robotics research Network.
His research interests include :
