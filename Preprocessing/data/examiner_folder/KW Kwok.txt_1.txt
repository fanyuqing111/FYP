Research Overview
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University
The first lead-free electro-optic (EO) polycrystalline ceramic with excellent transparency and strong linear electro-optic 
response, which are even better than the lead-based counterparts that are widely used in industries for various optoelectronic 
applications. 
Via taking the advantages of the characteristics of ferroelectric materials such as the switchable spontaneous polarization, 
phase transformation, ergodicity and electric field-induced strains, we have successfully realized real-time and reversible 
modulation of photoluminescence by in situ electric field in lead-free ferroelectric ceramics at room temperature. The 
physical mechanism and the interplay process between the electric field and photoluminescence have also be elucidated 
in detail based on the in situ structural investigation.
Large and tunable photoluminescence responses of Eu−BNT6BT relaxor
