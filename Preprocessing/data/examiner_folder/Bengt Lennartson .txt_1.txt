Bengt Lennartson
Professor, Head of Division, Systems and Control, Electrical Engineering
Bengt Lennartson is heading the Division of Systems and Control, and he is a Professor of Automation since
1999. He is IEEE Fellow for his contributions to hybrid and discrete event systems for automation and sustainable
production. He is (co)author of 280+ peer reviewed international papers. Currently, much intention is focused on
sustainability, including energy minimization of robot cells. Collaboration with industry involves Volvo, Daimler,
Kuka, and TetraPak.
