Biography
Roman Genov received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Rochester Institute of
Technology, NY in 1996 and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer
Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD in 1998 and 2003 respectively. 
Prof. Genov held engineering positions at Atmel Corporation, Columbia, MD in 1995 and
Xerox Corporation, Rochester, NY in 1996. He was a visiting researcher in the Laboratory of
Intelligent Systems at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland
in 1998 and in the Center for Biological and Computational Learning at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA in 1999. He has been on faculty of The Edward S.
Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto
since 2002.  Prof. Genov’s research interests include analog and digital VLSI circuits, systems
and algorithms for energy-efficient signal processing with applications to electrical, chemical
and photonic sensory information acquisition, biosensor arrays, neural interfaces, parallel
signal processing, adaptive computing for pattern recognition, and implantable and wearable
biomedical electronics.
