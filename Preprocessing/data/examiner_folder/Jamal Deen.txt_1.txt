SHORT BIOGRAPHY
SHORT BIOGRAPHY: M. Jamal Deen, born in Georgetown, Guyana, South America, is 
Distinguished University Professor, Senior Canada Research Chair in Information Technology, and 
Director of the Micro- and Nano-Systems Laboratory, McMaster University. He completed a B.Sc. degree 
in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Guyana (1978), a M.S. degree (1982) and a Ph.D. 
degree (1985) in Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics at Case Western Reserve University 
(CWRU), Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A. His Ph.D. dissertation was on the design and modeling of a new CARS 
spectrometer for dynamic temperature measurements and combustion optimization in rocket and jet 
engines and was sponsored and used by NASA, Cleveland, USA. He received four honorary doctorate 
degrees from the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada (2011), the Universidad de Granada, Granada, 
Spain (2012), the Universitat Rovira I Virgili (URV), Tarragona, Spain (2014), and El Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y
