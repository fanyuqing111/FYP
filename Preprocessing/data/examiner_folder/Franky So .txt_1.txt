So's interests include processing, and electronic and optical properties of electronic materials based 
on small molecule compounds and polymers, quantum dots and perovskite materials used for 
optoelectronic device and sensor applications. 
Franky So started his career as a research scientist working for Hoechst Celanese Research Division 
on polymer optical modulators. In 1993, he joined Motorola and then became the head of the OLED 
research group. In 2001, and he joined OSRAM Opto Semiconductors and became the Head of OLED 
Research. He joined the University of Florida in 2005 and became the Rolf E. Hummel Professor in 
Electronic Materials in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of 
Florida. In 2015, he joined the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the North 
Carolina State University where he is currently the Walter and Ida Freeman Distinguished Professor. 
While at Motorola, he was named the Distinguished Innovator and Master Innovator. He was the 
recipient of the DOE Solid State Lighting Program Significant Achievement Awards. Dr. So holds 80 
issued patents and has published more than 150 peer-reviewed articles with a Google H-index of 59. 
He is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Materials Science and Engineering Reports and serves as an 
Associate Editor for IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics, IEEE Journal of Display Technology, SPIE Journal of 
Photonic Technology and Organic Electronics. So is a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Photonics 
Society, a Charter Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, a Fellow of IEEE, OSA and SPIE. 
So's current research focus is on electronics properties and photophysics of organic semiconductors 
and quantum dots used for OLEDs, solar cells, photodetectors, sensors and transistors. His recent 
works include: use of corrugated structures to fabricate OLEDs and perovskite solar cells, charge 
transport, injection and charge transfer excitons in organic semiconductors, dielectric properties of 
polymer-fullerene blends for photovoltaics, vertical permeable metal base transistors, vertical field 
effect transistors, PbS quantum dots photodetectors and phototransistors, and ferroelectric 
transistors.
