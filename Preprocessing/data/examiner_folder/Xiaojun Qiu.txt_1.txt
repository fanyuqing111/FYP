Research Expertise 
Active Noise Control 
Application of active noise control (ANC) in the reduction of noise using controllable 
secondary sources to affect generation, radiation, transmission, and reception of the 
original primary noise source. Use of ANC to reduce low frequency noise problems 
where current passive noise control methods do not work because of weight and 
volume constraints. Development of alternative noise control solutions where current 
passive noise control methods cannot be applied. 
Projects include ANC barriers, windows, and headsets, as well as the active control 
of range hood noise and transformer noise, ANC in rooms and the design of an 
active noise controller. Collaborations include KCGM, Transurban, Huawei, and 
several electric power companies.

Room Acoustics 
Measurement and analysis of sound fields in long narrow spaces, such as tunnels 
and corridors, as well as flat rooms such as canteens and factory 
workshops.  Acoustical design of auditoria and gymnasiums, and the measurement 
and design of sound absorption materials and structures.  Development of new 
sound insulation materials and structures for us in the control of sound fields in 
rooms.

Biography 
Xiaojun Qiu received his Bachelor and Master degrees from Peking University in 
1989 and 1992, and his PhD from Nanjing University in 1995, all majoring in 
Acoustics. He worked in the University of Adelaide, Australia, as a Research Fellow 
in the field of active noise control with Professor Colin Hansen from 1997 to 2002, 
and has been with the Institute of Acoustics of Nanjing University as a professor on 
Acoustics and Signal processing since 2002. He visited the Institute of Technical 
Acoustics (RWTH Aachen), Germany, as a Humboldt Research Fellow in 2008, 
working in the field of sound field reproduction with Professor Michael Vorländer. He 
worked at RMIT University as a Professor of Design on Audio Engineering from 2013 
to 2016, and now he is a Professor in Audio, Acoustics and Vibration in University of 
Technology Sydney. 
His main research areas include noise and vibration control, room acoustics, electro-
acoustics and audio signal processing, particularly applications of active control 
technologies. He is a member of Audio Engineering Society and an elected director 
of the international Institute of Acoustics and Vibration, and serves as an Associate 
Technical Editor for the Journal of Audio Engineering Society. He has published 2 
books, 5 book chapters and more than 350 technique papers, and has been the 
principal investigator for numerous projects. He has also applied more than 90 
patents on audio acoustics and audio signal processing.
