He joined the Department of Electronic Engineering at City University of Hong Kong in 1985 as a 
Lecturer. Two years later, he moved to the Department of Electronic Engineering at The Chinese 
University of Hong Kong where he spent four years. Professor Luk returned to the City University of 
Hong Kong in 1992, and he is currently Chair Professor of Electronic Engineering. He served as Head 
of Department of Electronic Engineering from August 2004 to July 2010. His recent research interests 
include design of patch, planar and dielectric resonator antennas, microwave and antenna 
measurements, and computational electromagnetics. He is the author of three books, 9 research book 
chapters, over 260 journal papers and 200 conference papers. He was awarded 2 US and more than 10 
PRC patents on the design of a wideband patch antenna with an L-shaped probe.
