Current Major Research Grants / Funding:   
  
• 
Title: High Efficiency Organic PV: Agency:  ORI, FRST. Amount:  6 million (6 years). (Key 
Researcher) 2009 – 2015 
Abstract: The world is facing a major challenge in meeting the growing demand for energy, 
and securing an affordable energy solution that does not compromise our environmental 
responsibilities. This bid is aimed toward answering that challenge, and by 2016 aspires to 
produce an all-plastic, recyclable, high efficiency photovoltaic (PV) cell that can be 
incorporated into a roofing product (Intelliroof®), which is capable of providing the total 
average energy requirements for a household. The beneficiaries will in the first instance be 
New Zealanders, with access to cheaper, cleaner energy, and an assurance of supply. It will 
also have significant impact on reducing the effects on the environment associated with 
generation and transmission of the grid-tied energy solutions. In the longer term, it will play a 
significant role in meeting a very real global need for clean, sustainable energy, which is not 
produced at the cost of our environment. 
 
• 
Title: High Performance Sensors; Agency: High-Value Manufacturing and Services 
Research Fund, MBIE, NZ. Amount: 9 million (4 years). (key Researcher) 2012-2016. 
Abstract: This bid supports the development of high tech manufacturing in NZ in the form of a 

-----
 
 
new sensing platform technology, and its application to address issues in the Dairy and 
Aquaculture Industries. The bid brings together scientific and engineering teams from CRIs, 
Academia and Industry with expertise in manufacturing, sensor development and decades of 
funded research into the understanding of production, disease and hygiene related to the 
chosen application areas.
