Curriculum 
vitae
Davide Dardari received his Laurea degree in Electronic Engineering (summa cum laude) and his Ph.D. in Electronic 
Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Bologna, Italy, in 1993 and 1998, respectively. 
From 1998 to 2000 he was under contract with the Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni 
(CNIT), Italy, working on both the experimentation of multimedia services through heterogeneous satellite networks and 
the design of DSP-based CDMA satellite modems within projects funded by ASI (Italian Space Agency). 
From 2000 to 2005, he was a lecturer and a Research Associate at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informatica e 
Sistemistica (DEIS), University of Bologna.
Since 2005, he has been an Associate Professor at the University of Bologna at Cesena, where he has participated with 
Dipartimento di Elettronica Informatica e Sistemistica (DEIS), now Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Energia Elettrica e 
dell'Informazione “Guglielmo Marconi” (DEI).
He is also Research Affiliate at IEIIT/CNR (National Research Council) and CNIT.
During winter-spring 2005 he was a Visiting Researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge (USA), 
working in the field of ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) technology for communication and localization.
Since 2005, he has been a Research Affiliate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, USA.
Since 2005, he has been an Associate Professor at the University of Bologna at Cesena, Cesena (FC), Italy, where he 
participates with WiLAB (Wireless Communications Laboratory).
He published more than 200 technical papers and he has collaborated in many National and European Projects in some of 
which he taken the role of research unit leader or work package responsible. In particular the following projects are 
mentioned: ESA Project “LOST”, H2020 European projects “XCYCLE”, FP7 European projects SELECT, DORII, EUWB, 
PHOENIX, PROMETHEUS, and European Networks of Excellence "NEWCOM-NEWCOM++"; MIUR "WWLAN" project for 
wideband high speed wireless LAN; several CNIT/ASI joint projects (for example “WAVE” project); MIUR FIRB and PRIN 
projects, respectively, "VICOM" (Virtual Immersive Communications), CRIMSON and GRETA.
His interests are on wireless communications, localization techniques, and distributed signal processing.
He is co-author of the books “Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks: enabling technologies, information processing and 
protocol design”, Elsevier, 2008 and “Satellite and Terrestrial Radio Positioning Techniques - A signal processing 
perspective”, Elsevier 2011. 
He received the IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society’s M. Barry Carlton Award (2011), the IEEE Communications 
Society Fred W. Ellersick Prize (2012) and other Best Paper Awards.
Prof. Dardari is Senior Member of the IEEE where he was the Chair for the Radio Communications Committee of the IEEE 
Communication Society. 
He is Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Communication Society (2018-2019). 
He was co-General Chair of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband and co-organizer of the IEEE 
International Workshop on Advances in Network Localization and Navigation (ANLN) - ICC 2013-2016 editions. 
He was also TPC Chair of IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC 
2018), TPC co-Chair of the Wireless Communications Symposium of the 2007/2017 IEEE International Conference on 
Communications, and TPC co-Chair of the 2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband. 
He served as Lead Guest Editor for the EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (Special Issues on Cooperative 
Localization in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks, and on Network Localization), Guest Editor for Proceedings of IEEE 
(Special Issue on UWB Technology & Emerging Applications), for the Physical Communication Journal (ELSEVIER) (Special 
Issue on Advances in UWB Wireless Communications) and for IEEE Trans. on Vehicular Technology (Special Session on 
indoor localization, tracking, and mapping with heterogeneous technologies). 
He served as an Associate Editor for IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS from 2006 to 2012.
