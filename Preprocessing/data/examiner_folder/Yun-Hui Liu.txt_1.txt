Biography 
 
Yunhui Liu received the B.Eng. degree in applied dynamics from Beijing Institute of Technology, 
Beijing, China, in 1985, the M.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, 
Japan, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematical engineering and information physics from the 
University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1992. 
 
He worked with the Electrotechnical Laboratory, MITI, Japan, from 1992 to 1995. Since February 
1995, he has been with the Chinese University of Hong Kong and is currently a Professor at the 
Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering. He is also a ChangJiang Professor (visiting) 
of the National University of Defense Technology and a Visiting Professor of Harbin Institute of 
Technology. He has published over 200 papers in refereed journals and refereed conference 
proceedings. His research interests include visual servoing, medical robotics, multifingered robot 
hands, mobile robots, sensor networks, and machine intelligence. Dr. Liu has received numerous 
research awards from international journals and international conferences in robotics and 
automation and government agencies. He is the Editor‐in‐Chief of a new journal "Robotics and 
Biomimetics" to be launched in 2014 by Springer and an Editor of Advanced Robotics. He was an 
Associate Editor of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION from 2001 to 2004 
and the general chair of the 2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and 
Systems (IROS).
