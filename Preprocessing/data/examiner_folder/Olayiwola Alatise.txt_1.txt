focused on the mixed signal performance enhancements in srained Si/SiGe MOSFETs (metal
oxide on semiconductor feld efect transisors). In 2004 and 2005, Layi briefy joined ATMEL North
Tyneside where he worked on the process integration of the 130 nm CMOS technology node. In
June 2008, he joined the Innovation R&D department of NXP semiconductors as a development
Engineer where he designed, processed and qualifed discrete power trench MOSFETs for
automotive applications and switched mode power supplies. In November 2010, Layi joined
Warwick University as a Science City Research Fellow to invesigate advanced power
semiconductor materials and devices for improved energy conversion efciency. In October 2011,
he was appointed as an Assisant Professor of Electrical Engineering, in October 2014 he was
appointed as an Associate Professor in Power Electronics and as of July 2017 has been appointed
as a Reader in Power Electronics. He is currently the leader of an MSc module in Electrical
Machines and teaches undergraduate Electrical power Engineering. Dr Alatise is the principle
invesigator and co-Invesigator of several EPSRC and TSB projects in Power Electronics and has
written several scientifc journal papers, served as a reviewer for the IEEE journals, is a member of
the IEEE and IET as well as a Chartered Engineer.
