Myron Begeman Fellowship
Associate Professor
Dr. Mikhail Belkin is an Associate Professor and holds the Myron 
Begeman Fellowship in the Department of Electrical & 
Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. 
He received his B.S. degree in Physics and Mathematics from 
Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology in 1998 and Ph.D. 
in Physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 2004. 
From 2004 to 2008 he worked in Federico Capasso’s group in 
the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard 
University, first as a postdoctoral fellow and later as a research 
associate. He joined the faculty of the University of Texas at 
Austin in the fall of 2008. 
Dr. Belkin’s research interests are in the areas of mid-infrared 
and THz photonics, optoelectronics, and nonlinear optics. 
Current projects include the investigation of exotic linear and 
nonlinear optical effects in metamaterials and low-dimensional 
structures, development and application of compact room-
temperature THz sources and detectors based on quantum 
cascade laser technology, tunable plasmonic devices, integrated 
mid-infrared photonics systems, and sub-wavelength resolution 
vibrational spectroscopy.  
Dr. Belkin has co-authored over 150 journal and conference 
papers. He is a Fellow of the OSA and a Senior Member of IEEE. 
His recent awards include the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel 
Research Award from Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the 
National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the DARPA Young 
Faculty Award, the AFOSR Young Investigator Program Award, 
and the Norman Hackerman Advanced Research Program Award 
for Young Investigators from the state of Texas. Dr. Belkin has 
also been selected as 2014 Tour Speaker for the Society for 
Applied Spectroscopy. He is the chair of the Central Texas 
chapter the IEEE Photonics Society.
