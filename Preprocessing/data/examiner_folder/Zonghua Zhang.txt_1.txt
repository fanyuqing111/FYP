Biography 
Zonghua Zhang is a Full Professor of IMT Lille Douai, Institut Mines-Télécom. 
He used to work as a full-time researcher at NICT (Japan), INRIA (France), and 
University of Waterloo (Canada). He holds a Ph.D. degree (JAIST, Japan) in 
information science, and a HDR diploma (UPMC, France) in computer science. 
Zonghua has more than 17 years experiences in the domain of information and 
network security, and contributed to more than a dozen national and 
international collaborative research projects dedicated to Cybersecurity. His 
research topics cover anomaly detection, network forensics, trust and reputation 
management, and security protocols. The current target scenarios include 
Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization 
(NFV), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) (e.g., e-healthcare and Intelligent 
Transportation Systems). He serves as the editorial board member of Computer 
& Security (COSE), Security and Communication Networks (SCN), 
International Journal of Network Security (IJNS), and IEEE Communications 
Magazine.
