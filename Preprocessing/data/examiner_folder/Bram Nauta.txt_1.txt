About Me
Bram Nauta was born in 1964 in Hengelo, The Netherlands. In 1987 he received the M.Sc degree (cum laude) in electrical 
engineering from the University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands. In 1991 he received the Ph.D. degree from the same 
university on the subject of analog CMOS filters for very high frequencies. In 1991 he joined the Mixed-Signal Circuits and 
Systems Department of Philips Research, Eindhoven the Netherlands. In 1998 he returned to the University of Twente, where he 
is currently a distinguished professor, heading the IC Design group. Since 2016 he also serves as chair of the EE department at 
this university. His current research interest is high-speed analog CMOS circuits, software defined radio, cognitive radio and 
beamforming.
He served as the Editor-in-Chief (2007-2010) of the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC), and was the 2013 program chair 
of the International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC). He is currently the President of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits 
Society (2018-2019 term). 
Also, he served as Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II (1997-1999), and of JSSC (2001-2006). He 
was in the Technical Program Committee of the Symposium on VLSI circuits (2009-2013) and is in the steering committee and 
programme committee of the European Solid State Circuit Conference (ESSCIRC).  He served as distinguished lecturer of the 
IEEE,  is co-recipient of the ISSCC 2002 and 2009 "Van Vessem Outstanding Paper Award" and in 2014 he received the ‘Simon 
Stevin Meester’ award (500.000€), the largest Dutch national prize for achievements in technical sciences. He is fellow of the 
IEEE and member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW)
