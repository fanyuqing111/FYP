Biography
Sennur Ulukus is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
University of Maryland at College Park, where she also holds a joint appointment
with the Institute for Systems Research (ISR). Prior to joining UMD, she was a
Senior Technical Staff Member at AT&T Labs-Research. She received her Ph.D.
degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Wireless Information
Network Laboratory (WINLAB), Rutgers University, and B.S. and M.S. degrees in
Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University. Her research
interests are in wireless communications, information theory, signal processing,
and networks, with recent focus on information theoretic physical layer security,
private information retrieval, energy harvesting communications, and wireless
energy and information transfer.
Dr. Ulukus is a fellow of the IEEE, and a Distinguished Scholar-Teacher of the
University of Maryland. She received the 2003 IEEE Marconi Prize Paper Award in
Wireless Communications, an 2005 NSF CAREER Award, the 2010-2011 ISR
Outstanding Systems Engineering Faculty Award, and the 2012 ECE George
Corcoran Education Award. Dr. Ulukus is on the Editorial Board of the IEEE
Transactions on Green Communications and Networking (2016–). She was an
Editor for the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications–Series on
Green Communications and Networking (2015-2016), IEEE Transactions on
Information Theory (2007-2010), and IEEE Transactions on Communications
(2003-2007). She was a Guest Editor for the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications (2015 and 2008), Journal of Communications and Networks
(2012), and IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (2011). She was a general
TPC co-chair of 2017 IEEE ISIT, 2016 IEEE Globecom, 2014 IEEE PIMRC, and
2011 IEEE CTW.
