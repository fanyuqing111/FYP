Vincenzo Matta is an Associate Professor at the Department of Information & Electrical Engineering 
and Applied Mathematics of the University of Salerno. 
His research interests cover the wide area of statistical signal processing and information theory, with 
current emphasis on the interplay between inference, communications and security in distributed 
systems, adaptation and learning over networks, multiobject/multisensor tracking and data fusion, 
detection of gravitational waves. He has published about 90 articles, on international journals, and 
proceedings of international conferences. 
Vincenzo Matta serves as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information 
Processing over Networks, for the IEEE Signal Processing Letters, and for the IEEE Transactions on 
Aerospace and Electronic Systems.
