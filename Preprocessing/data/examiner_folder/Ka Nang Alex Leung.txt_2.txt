Resume of Career
Resume of Career
Professor Alex Leung received the B.Eng., M.Phil., and Ph.D. degrees, all in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (now the 
department is renamed to Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering), from the Hong Kong University of Science and 
Technology (HKUST). He stayed at HKUST immediately after he got the Ph.D degree in 2002 and became a Visiting Assistant 
Professor. After his 3-year service to HKUST, he joined Department of Electronic Engineering of the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong (CUHK) in 2005. He is currently an Associate Professor.
He is a senior member of IEEE, and he was the chairman of the IEEE (Hong Kong) Electron Device/Solid-State Circuit Joint 
Chapter in 2012. He serves in the editorial board of Active and Passive Electronic Components, Hindawi Publishing Corporation, 
and he serves as paper reviewer in numerous IEEE & IET journals and international conferences. He involves actively in the 
organization of several IEEE international conferences.
