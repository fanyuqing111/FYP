All, 
 
They have signed corp lab NDA. Shicong is not associated with corp lab so NDA is required.

Hello Harwati, 
 
In that case, Amit would be the best person to suggest that. 
 
Amit, 
What do you think? Shicong’s examination panel members are saying that they have already signed RR project contract. 
Do they need to sign separate NDA for Shicong’s thesis examination? Shicong’s thesis has confidential information which 
have been filed as patent. 
 
Thanks. 
Best Regards,. 
Souvik

Hello Dr Souvik 
 
Thank you for your email. 
We have requested the EEE examiners to sign NDA explaining the RR terms and NDA requirements. 
But some feedback we got was: they have project in RR and signing NDA again is not necessary. 
 
Thank you and best regards

Hello Harwati, 
 
As Rejeki mentioned, Shicong’s thesis has RR confidential info and some of the staff are filled as patent as well.  
Can we explain Internal Examiner,  Panel members and Panel Chair the situation and request for signing the NDA again?  
 
Thanks.

Hi Harwati,  
 
As long as I know, Yang Shicong was IPP student in Rolls‐Royce. He was/is a Rolls‐Royce staff. But his PhD thesis is done 
under RR@NTU Corp.  Lab.  
And I had discussion with his Project Manager (Dr. Souvik Dasgupta), His thesis will need RR‐PCC Approval and also the 
examiner will need to sign NDA because some of the idea in the thesis is under patent process.  
 
Best regards, 
Rejeki

Dear Dr Rejeki 
  
The 2 external examiners for YANG SHICONG thesis examination have agreed and signed NDA. 
  
But the Internal Examiner: Assoc Prof Gooi Hoay Beng, Oral Panel member : Prof Wang Peng and Chairman for 
Oral Exam : Prof Wang Youyi, have declined to sign NDA. 
  
Can I proceed to complete the nomination of the above examiners for YANG SHICONG thesis examination? 
  
Also could you please link us with the Manager for YANG SHICONG thesis examination. 
  
Thank you and best regards 
  
Harwati
