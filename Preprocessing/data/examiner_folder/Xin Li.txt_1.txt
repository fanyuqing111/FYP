Xin Li
Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Prof. Xin Li received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from 
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2005, and the M.S. and 
B.S. degrees in Electronics Engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 
2001 and 1998, respectively.
In 2005, he co-founded Xigmix Inc. to commercialize his PhD research, and served 
as the Chief Technical Officer until the company was acquired by Extreme DA in 
2007. In 2011, Extreme DA was further acquired by Synopsis (Nasdaq: SNPS). 
From 2009 to 2012, he was the Assistant Director for FCRP Focus Research Center 
for Circuit & System Solutions (C2S2), a national consortium of 13 research 
universities (CMU, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, UIUC, UMich, Columbia, UCLA, among 
others) chartered by the U.S. semiconductor industry and U.S. Department of 
Defense to work on next-generation integrated circuit design challenges. From 
2014 to 2015, he was the Assistant Director for the Center for Silicon System 
Implementation (CSSI), a CMU research center with 20 faculty members working 
on integrated circuits and systems. His research interests include integrated 
circuit, signal processing and data analytics.
He was an Associate Editor of IEEE Trans. on Biomedical Engineering (TBME), IEEE

Selection Committee, the Executive Committee of ISVLSI, GLSVLSI and iNIS, and 
the Technical Program Committee of DAC, ICCAD, ITC, ISVLSI, FAC, CAD/Graphics, 
ASICON and VLSI. He received the NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award 
(CAREER) in 2012, two IEEE Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Awards in 2013 and 
2016, the Best Paper Award from Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2010, 
two IEEE/ACM William J. McCalla ICCAD Best Paper Awards in 2004 and 2011, and 
the Best Paper Award from International Symposium on Integrated Circuits (ISIC) 
in 2014. In addition to these awards, he also received six Best Paper Nominations 
from Design Automation Conference (DAC), International Conference on 
Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) and Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 
(CICC).
