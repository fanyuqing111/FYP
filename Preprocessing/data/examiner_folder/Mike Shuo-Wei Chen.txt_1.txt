Analog Mixed-Signal IC Group
Mike Chen
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR
Mike Shuo-Wei Chen is currently an Associate Professor at 
Electrical Engineering Department, USC, and holds Colleen and 
Roberto Padovani Early Career Chair position. 
He received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, 
Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degree from 
University of California, Berkeley, in 2002 and 2006, all in 
electrical engineering. 
GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCHER
From 2001 to 2006, he was a Graduate Research Assistant at Berkeley Wireless 
Research Center, working on mixed-signal circuits, ultra-wideband (UWB), digital 
baseband and ASIC implementation. During that time, he naively proposed and 
demonstrated the first asynchronous SAR ADC architecture, which has been adopted 
today for low-power high-speed analog-to-digital conversion products in industry. 
Since 2006, he has been a member of Analog IC Group at Atheros Communications 
(now Qualcomm-Atheros), Santa Clara, CA, working on mixed-signal and RF circuits 
for various wireless communication products. After joining USC in 2011, he leads an 
analog mixed-signal circuit group, focusing on high-speed low-power data converters, 
Bio-inspired electronics, RF frequency synthesizers, DSP-enabled analog circuits and 
systems. His students and himself have a lot of fun exploring new circuit architectures 
that excel beyond the technology limitation.
Dr. Chen was the recipient of NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) 
Award and DARPA Young Faculty Award (YFA) both in 2014. He also achieved an 
honourable mention in the Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad, 1994, UC Regentsâ€™ 
Fellowship at Berkeley in 2000 and Analog Devices Outstanding Student Award for 
recognition in IC design in 2006.
