Biography 
Athanasios D. Panagopoulos (S’98, M’02, SM’09): was born in Athens, Greece on 
January 26, 1975. He received the Diploma Degree in Electrical and Computer 
Engineering (summa cum laude) and the Dr. Engineering Degree from National 
Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in July 1997 and in April 2002. From May 2002 to 
July 2003, he served the Technical Corps of Hellenic Army. In September 2003, he 
joined School of Pedagogical and Technological Education, as part-time Assistant 
Professor, up to June 2008. From January 2005 to May 2008, he was Head of the 
Satellite Division of Hellenic Authority for the Information and Communication Security 
and Privacy. From May 2008 to May 2013 he was Lecturer in the School of Electrical 
and Computer Engineering of NTUA and now he is Assistant Professor. He has 
published more than 120 papers in international journals and more than 150 papers 
conference proceedings. He has also published more than 25 Book Chapters in 
International Books. He is the recipient of URSI General Assembly Young Scientist 
Award in 2002 (Commission F) and 2005 (Commission C). He is co-recipient of the Best 
Paper Award in the 2006 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium.  His research interests 
include radio communication systems design, mobile computing technologies, wireless 
and satellite communications networks and the propagation effects on multiple access 
systems and on communication protocols. He participates to ITU-R and ETSI Study 
Groups, he is member of Technical Chamber of Greece and Senior Member of IEEE. He 
is Chairman of the IEEE Greek Communication Chapter. He serves on the editorial 
boards of International Journal of Antennas and Propagation and Elsevier Physical 
Communication. Finally, he is an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Antennas 
and Propagation and an Associate Editor in IEEE Communication Letters.
