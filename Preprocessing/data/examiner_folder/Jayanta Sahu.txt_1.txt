Professor Jayanta Sahu
Academic Staff
Head of Silica Fibre Fabrication
Member of High Power Fibre Lasers
Jayanta received a PhD from the Indian Institute of Technology in 1997 where he worked on the development of rare-earth doped optical
fibres, the MCVD technique, and doped glasses using solgel techniques.
From 1997 to April 2000, he held a research engineer position at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, where he was
engaged in development of silica based planar waveguide devices, based on Plasma deposition and reactive ion etching.
Since he joined the ORC in May 2000, he has been with the silica fabrication group, where his current research interests are in optical
materials and in high power fibre lasers. Jayanta was appointed a professor in the ORC in June 2012.
