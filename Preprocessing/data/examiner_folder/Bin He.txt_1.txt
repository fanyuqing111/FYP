Research Interests
Top
Dr. Bin He's major research interests are in the field of neuroengineering and biomedical imaging. 
His research programs are funded by NIH (NIBIB, NCCIH, NINDS, NHLBI, NEI, OD), NSF, and ONR, 
among other sponsors. The active research programs in Dr. He's lab are as follows. 
Multimodal Functional Neuroimaging: Dr. He and his students have developed a unified theory for 
multimodal neuroimaging integrating the BOLD functional MRI and electrophysiological imaging. 
Hemodynamic neuroimaging, such as BOLD functional MRI, has high spatial resolution at mm scale but 
very slow in time. Electrophysiological neuroimaging has high temporal resolution at ms scale but limited 
spatial resolution. It has been a major frontier in the functional neuroimaging research to attempt to greatly 
enhance spatio-temporal resolution by integrating functional MRI with electrophysiological imaging. Dr. 
He and colleagues have developed a rigorous theory on neurovascular coupling, which provides a 
principled way of integrating BOLD functional MRI signals with electrophysiological signals for event-
related paradigms. The theory has been tested in human visual system and revealed a dramatic 
improvement in performance in imaging human visual information pathways. Dr. He and his students have 
further developed new algorithms to integrate fMRI and EEG/MEG signals for oscillatory brain activity. 
Currently both theoretical and experimental studies are actively pursued in Dr. He's lab to further develop 
the high resolution spatio-temporal functional neuroimaging modality, and to study the sensory, motor and 
cognitive functions of the brain using EEG/fMRI. 
Functional Neuroimaging of Epilepsy: Dr. He and colleagues have made significant contributions to 
high-resolution electrophysiological neuroimaging aiding neurosurgical planning in epilepsy patients. Due 
to the limited spatial resolution of scalp EEG, it is widely practiced in clinical settings that invasive 
intracranial recordings are obtained, by placing electrode sensors directly on the surface of or within the 
brain, to aid neurosurgical planning in patients with intractable epilepsy. Dr. He and his students have 
developed an innovative epilepsy source imaging methodology, in which causal interactions among 
sources are identified and imaged from noninvasive EEG recordings. Such imaging provides high spatial 
resolution in imaging distributed brain sources within the 3-dimensional brain volume and reveals neural 
interactions and connectivity embedded in the brain networks. Dr. He and colleagues have further 
developed an ICA based seizure imaging methodology and conducted a rigorous validation study in a 
group of epilepsy patients to image epileptogenic brain, and demonstrated high consistence between the 
imaged seizure sources and the epileptogenic zones determined by well established clinical procedures in 
the same patients. Active research is currently being pursued to further establish electrophysiological 
neuroimaging as a noninvasive tool aiding surgical planning in epilepsy patients. Other than EEG/MEG 
neuroimaging, Dr. He and his colleagues are also pursuing functional MRI mapping of epileptogenic zone 
from fMRI. This line of work is carried in collaboration with Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota 
Medical Center.
Electrical Properties Imaging: An important research program in Dr. He’s lab is the development and 
investigation of novel approaches for noninvasive imaging of electrical properties of biological tissues, 
including bioimpedance imaging. Dr. He and colleagues have proposed and developed a new approach 
called magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) by integrating ultrasound and 
biomagnetism, in order to obtain high resolution image of electrical impedance of biological tissue. In the 
MAT-MI approach, the object is placed in a static magnetic field and a pulsed magnetic field. The pulsed 
magnetic field induces eddy current in the object. Consequently, the object emits ultrasonic waves through 
the Lorentz force produced by the combination of the eddy current and the static magnetic field. The 
acoustic waves are then collected by the detectors located around the object for image reconstruction. 
MAT-MI takes the advantage of excellent contrast of electrical impedance and the high spatial resolution 
of ultrasound. The recent work demonstrates that the MAT-MI approach can achieve mm spatial resolution 
in imaging electrical impedance, which represents a significant advancement in comparison with the 
spatial resolution of conventional electrical impedance imaging approach, and may play a critically 
important role in early detection of breast cancer. Along the similar line, Dr. He and his colleagues have 
been developing a MR based electrical properties tomography (EPT) approach using B1 mapping of MR 
technology to reconstruct subject specific electrical properties distributions. EPT not only has great 
potential for clinical applications in cancer detection and diagnosis but also promises to provide subject 
specific SAR mapping, helping managing safety concerns in high or ultrahigh field MRI systems. The EPT 
project is carried in collaboration with CMRR investigators. 
Cardiac Electrical Tomography: Dr. He and colleagues have pioneered the development of 
electrophysiological cardiac tomography in assessing dynamic cardiac functions. The electrocardiographic 
inverse imaging problem has historically been solved using point dipole sources, epicardial potentials, or 
heart surface activation patterns. Dr. He and colleagues have developed cardiac electrical tomography 
techniques in his lab to image electrical functional information throughout the 3-dimensional volume of 
the heart from noninvasive electrocardiographic measurements. In collaboration with collaborators at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Minnesota Medical School, Dr. He and 
colleagues have validated this cardiac electrical tomography technology in animal models including 
rabbits, dogs, and swine where simultaneous intracardiac or intracavity potentials are measured together 
with body surface potential mapping. Currently pilot clinical studies are being carried out to test the 
efficacy and clinical applications of the cardiac electrical tomography techniques developed in Dr. He’s 
lab. The establishment of such imaging techniques promises to greatly impact the management of cardiac 
arrhythmia, a leading cause of public health problem in US and developed countries.
Brain-Computer Interface: Dr. He has made pioneering contributions to noninvasive brain-computer 
interface (BCI) research. This work is aimed at developing novel techniques for effectively decoding the 
intention of human subjects and controlling external device, which may ultimately benefit patients 
suffering from neurological disorders such as spinal cord injuries or stroke. Dr. He and his colleagues have 
developed a time-frequency-spatial approach to extract the extremely weak signals accompanying the 
“thought” of a human subject using an array of electrode sensors placed over the scalp. This method takes 
the “signatures” of each individual subject and uses them for optimal decoding of the intention of the 
human subject. Dr. He has proposed the concept of electrophysiological neuroimaging based BCI – an idea 
to estimate “virtual” intracranial signals from the noninvasive EEG recordings for substantially improving

the performance of noninvasive EEG based BCI. Dr. He and his colleagues have been aggressively 
investigating the mechanisms associated with motor imagery based BCI by using advanced neuroimaging 
techniques to delineate the brain sources accompanying motor imagery. Recently, Dr. He and his students 
have developed a 3-dimensional continuous brain-computer interface system to allow human subjects to 
control the flight of a flying robot from noninvasive brain waves. Click the video to see the mind 
controlled flying robot.
Neuromodulation: Dr. He and his colleagues are actively pursuing noninvasive neuromodulation 
modalities including transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial alternate current stimulation (tACS). 
Current interest ranges from basic studies of mechanisms of tFUS, TMS and tDCS/tACS by means of 
dynamic brain mapping, to clinical investigations in patients with stroke and schizophrenia. Other than 
treatment purposes, Dr. He and his students are pursuing perturbation based imaging in which 
neuromodulation is used to perturb the central nervous systems and responses measured using various 
neuroimaging methods for better understanding of brain circuits, networks and functions.
