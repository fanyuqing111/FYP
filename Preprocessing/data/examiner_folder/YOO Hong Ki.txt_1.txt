Research 
Biomedical Optics and Photomedicine is an interdisciplinary research area, which utilizes diverse optical technologies 
to address challenging medical problems. Novel optical technologies continue to advance at a rapid rate, enabling 
early diagnosis, screening, monitoring, and treatment of various medical conditions virtually in all medical fields 
ranging from ophthalmology and dermatology to gastroenterology and cardiology. 

-----
Research interest at the Biomedical Optics and Photomedicine Lab. focuses on the development of new optical 
imaging techniques, and its application to medical problems, in order to improve the patient care. We work on 
developing novel optical instrumentations and methods based on advanced optical techniques, such as optical 
frequency domain imaging, optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, and fluorescence molecular imaging. 
Specifically, our focus in this area is on the development of optical imaging catheters and endoscopic probes using 
optical fibers and micro optics. 
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in many developed countries. Advanced imaging catheters 
may open up new opportunities for investigating coronary artery disease by providing comprehensive information 
associated with high-risk plaques in vivo. Diagnosis, screening, and monitoring esophageal diseases involve a biopsy 
of suspicious tissue. High-resolution microendoscopy could provide a less-invasive method for monitoring and 
screening patients that does not require the excisional biopsy. 
We are putting a lot of effort into developing novel optical instrumentations and translating these new technologies 
into preclinical and clinical studies. Our researches will improve patient care by providing advanced diagnostic and 
therapeutic methods.
