(i) A/Prof. Sonar conducted research work at Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany (from August 2000 to October 2003) under the guidance of Prof.
Klaus Mullen (Director) and awarded a PhD degree in Material Chemistry (Organic Semiconductors and Optoelectronic Devices) by Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat,
Mainz, Germany  in 2004.  
(ii) After completion of his PhD, A/Prof. Sonar joined as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Freie University of Berlin and worked on spin transition dendritic organometallic
complexes with Prof. Dieter Schlüter. Dr. Sonar moved with Prof. Schlüter’s group at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH-Zurich), Switzerland as a Postdoctoral
Scientist and worked on thiophene based dendritic polymers for optoelectronic applications and stayed with his group till July 2006.
(iii) In August 2006, A/Prof. Sonar  joined as a Research Engineer at Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), Agency for Science, Technology and
Research (A*STAR), Singapore and worked in a Visiting Investigator Program (VIP) group led by Prof. Ananth Dodabalapur. The project entitled “Organic / Polymer
Electronics – Novel Materials & Device Structures for Applications in OPV, OFET & OLET” was heavily funded project (three phases) by Science and Engineering
Research Council (SERC) and A/Prof. Sonar contributed significantly and proved to be one of the most productive team members.
(iv) In April 2010, A/Prof. Sonar was promoted to Senior Research Engineer to Research Scientist-I and then to Research Scientist-II in April 2011 and 2013 respectively.
A/Prof. Sonar had done some phenomenal research work on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based and other class of printable high performance conjugated functional
materials for organic electronic applications and became a leading expert researcher in this area. DPP dye based organic semiconducting materials and their performances
are stellar results and the science of DPP is measured on a “log scale”, and is truly world-class. Many of these materials have led to world top class performance in
