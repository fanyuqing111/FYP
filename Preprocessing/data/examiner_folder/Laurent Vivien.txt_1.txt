Laurent Vivien received the Ph.D. degree in nonlinear optical properties of carbon nanotubes 
from the Polytechnique School, Palaiseau, France, in 2001. Between 2001 and 2003, he was 
with the Institute of Fundamental Electronics (IEF), Orsay, France, to develop single-mode and 
polarization-insensitive structures in SOI waveguides and the fiber coupling for optical 
telecommunication applications. Since 2003, he has been with the Centre National de la 
Recherche Scientifique, Institute of Fundamental Electronics, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, 
France. His research interests include silicon-based photonics from the passive structures 
including slot waveguides, optical couplers, photonic crystals, polarization rotators, etc., to 
optoelectronic devices including optical modulators, Ge on Si photodetectors, Ge/SiGe 
quantum well structures, strained silicon, carbon nanotubes based optoelectronic devices, 
etc. Since 2006, he has been the In-Charge of the Silicon Photonics Group at IEF. 
He is currently involved in several ANR and European projects as a Coordinator or WP leader. 
He has coauthored more than 200 peer-reviewed journal and conferences publications, and 
holds seven patents. He also presented his work in more than 200 international conferences 
and contributed to several books.
