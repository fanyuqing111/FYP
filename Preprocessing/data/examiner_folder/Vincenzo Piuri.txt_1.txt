Research
The research activity has been carried out in the field of information processing technology and systems, with
reference to distributed, massively-parallel and adaptive approaches, from the points of view of hardware, compu-
tational paradigms, and intensive-computing applications. In particular, the following areas have been addressed.
• Neural techniques, architectures and applications
Theoretical, architectural, and application aspects of artificial neural networks have been studied for im-
plementing optimized solutions, with particular reference to identification, prediction, control, signal, and
image processing applications. Design methodologies have been developed for designing embedded compos-
ite systems and fault tolerance systems. Advanced industrial applications have been realized for production
process and environmental monitoring, quality certification, and biomedical analysis.
• Biometrics techniques and systems
Biometrics technologies and systems, including multi-modal approaches, have been studied for person ver-
ification, identification and recognition as well as for behavioral analysis, with specific reference to security
applications.
Biometric technologies and systems have been evaluated from different points of view to
support a comprehensive design methodology. Privacy issues in biometrics have been analyzed.
• Distributed and parallel information processing architectures
Modeling approaches have been studied for concurrent processes and communications in distributed and
multiprocessor systems. Methodologies have been defined for evaluating process parallelism and system
dimensioning, including fault tolerance capacity. The virtual FPGA management and an innovative agent-
based distributed file system have been proposed.
• Arithmetic units
Algorithmic and structural characteristics of arithmetic units and systems have been studied. New ar-
chitectural solutions have been defined, with specific reference to high computational performance, high
modularity, regularity of the integrated implementation, and fault tolerance by using codes.
• Fault-tolerant architectures
Techniques and design methodologies have been studied for information processing systems with high
performance and fault tolerance characteristics. In particular, innovative solutions have been proposed for
array processors, and digital systems for signal and image processing applications.
Researches performed in these areas are strictly related since they focus on advanced performances and charac-
teristics, even if they consider different abstraction levels. The main goals have been the development of highly
adaptive functionalities and systems, the definition of structures and computational approaches having high com-
putational performance, and the definition of advanced fault tolerance capabilities. Studies and implementations
have been carried out with the purpose of integrating the theoretical analysis with the definition of methodologies
and tools to achieve practical results efficiently.
These researches have been carried out within national and international projects, in cooperation with Italian
universities (University of Bologna, Brescia, Genova, Modena, Pavia, Padova, Salerno, Trento, Udine, Politecnico
di Bari, Politecnico di Torino), foreign universities (Austin - TX-USA, Berkeley - CA-USA, Boulder - CO-USA,
