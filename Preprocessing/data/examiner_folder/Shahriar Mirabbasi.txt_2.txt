PROFESSOR
Shahriar Mirabbasi
Analog and mixed-signal intergrated circuits and systems design, integrated circuit
design with an emphasis on high-speed data communication and signal processing
applications.
Shahriar Mirabbasi received the BSc in electrical engineering from Sharif
University of Technology in 1990, and the MASc and PhD in electrical and
computer engineering from the University of Toronto in 1997 and 2002,
respectively. Since August 2002, he has been with the Department of Electrical
and Computer Engineering, UBC where he is currently a Professor.
Dr. Mirabbasi and his team’s research interests include analog, mixed-signal,
and RF integrated circuit and system design for wireless and wireline data
communication, data converter, sensor interface, and biomedical applications.
