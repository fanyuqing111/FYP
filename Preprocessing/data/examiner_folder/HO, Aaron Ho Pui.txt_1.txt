Resume of Career
Resume of Career
Professor Aaron H.P. Ho received his B.Eng. and Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Nottingham in 
1986 and 1990 respectively. He has held academic positions as Associate Dean of Engineering, CUHK (2007-2010), Assistant 
Professor in the Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong (1996-2002).
Prior to returning to Hong Kong, Aaron was with Hewlett-Parkard (1994-1996). His responsibility was process development for 
high-volume production of InGaAs PIN diodes and InGaAsP buried multiquantum well heterostructure 1300/1550nm lasers. His 
industrial experience covers metal-organic vapour phase epitaxial growth (MOVPE), wafer scale InP device fabrication and 
packaging of telecom photonic products.
After completing his Ph.D. thesis entitled Zinc Diffusion Enhanced Disordering in AlAs-GaAs Superlattices, Aaron did 5 years of 
post-doc (1989-1994) at University of Nottingham and University of Leeds, UK. He was involved in two research projects: (i) giant 
magneto-resistance of Co/Cu superlattices prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), (ii) laser ultrasound generation and 
detection for non-destructive evaluation of ceramic coatings (sponsored by Rolls-Royce aircraft engine division). The intensive 
exposure in solid-state physics, thin-film material science and laser optics has been very instrumental in preparing Aaron’s 
subsequent academic career.
Aaron’s publication covers 120 peer-reviewed journal papers, 120 conference presentation, 4 book chapters, 5 US and 16 Chinese 
patents.
