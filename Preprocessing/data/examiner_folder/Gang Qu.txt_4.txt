RE: [ZHENG YUE(G1500300E)] - (Thesis Initiation Nomination of Examiners(PhD) Form) submitted by 
Chang Chip Hong 
Dear Harwati, 
 
The student indicated that her thesis contains confidential information because there will be an extended part of a piece of 
work in her chapter that has not yet been submitted to any journal for publication. As there is no company involved for her 
PhD work, most of the NDA clauses do not apply and the confidentiality requirement can be removed. 
 
Best regards, 
 
Chip Hong

Dear Prof Chang 
 
You have indicated that this thesis contains confidential information, Could we have the reason, fyi all examiners will be 
required to sign the attached NDA. 
We hope to have your clarifications, please.
