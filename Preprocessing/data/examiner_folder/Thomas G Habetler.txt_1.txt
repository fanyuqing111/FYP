Prof. Habetler is a native of Racine, 
Wisconsin. He received the B.S.E.E. degree in 
1981 and the M.S. degree in 1984, both in 
electrical engineering, from Marquette 
University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the 
Ph.D. degree from the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, in 1989.
From 1983-1985, he was employed by the 
Electro-Motive Division of General Motors as 
a Project Engineer. While there, he was 
involved in the design of switching power 
supplies and voltage regulators for 
locomotive applications. In 1985 he was 
awarded the General Motors Fellowship to 
attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Dr. Habetler is most well known for his work 
in sensorless (current- and voltage-based) 
condition monitoring of electric machines. 
This includes sensorless bearing fault 
detection, turn-to-turn insulation fault 
detection and rotating mechanical 
fault/unbalance detection. Practical, low cost 
on-line motor monitoring has been achieved 
in his work though the use of neural network-
based systems that eliminate the need for 
maintenance experts to interpret the data. 
This has led to a significant amount of 

-----
research in neural network applications in 
power electronics. Other research areas 
include speed-sensorless direct torque 
control of ac machines, sensorless speed 
estimation, sensorless temperature 
estimation, and controlled rectifiers.
He currently serves as President of the IEEE 
Power Electronics Society, and as Chair of 
the Industrial Power Converter Committee of 
the IEEE Industry Applications Society. He 
has published over 75 technical papers in 
power electronics and electric machines, and 
has worked closely with industry while at 
Georgia Tech.
Research interests: 
• Current-based condition monitoring of 
electric machines
• Control of electric machine drives
• Power electronics
• Design and protection of electric 
machines
