Biography
Johan A.K. Suykens was born in Willebroek Belgium, May 18 1966. He received the master degree in 
Electro-Mechanical Engineering and the PhD degree in Applied Sciences from the Katholieke Universiteit 
Leuven, in 1989 and 1995, respectively. In 1996 he has been a Visiting Postdoctoral Researcher at the 
University of California, Berkeley. He has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Fund for Scientific 
Research FWO Flanders and is currently a full Professor with KU Leuven. He is author of the books 
"Artificial Neural Networks for Modelling and Control of Non-linear Systems" (Kluwer Academic 
Publishers) and "Least Squares Support Vector Machines" (World Scientific), co-author of the book 
"Cellular Neural Networks, Multi-Scroll Chaos and Synchronization" (World Scientific) and editor of the 
books "Nonlinear Modeling: Advanced Black-Box Techniques" (Kluwer Academic Publishers), "Advances 
in Learning Theory: Methods, Models and Applications" (IOS Press) and "Regularization, Optimization, 
Kernels, and Support Vector Machines" (Chapman & Hall/CRC). In 1998 he organized an International 
Workshop on Nonlinear Modelling with Time-series Prediction Competition. He has served as associate 
editor for the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems (1997-1999 and 2004-2007), the IEEE 
Transactions on Neural Networks (1998-2009) and the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and 
Learning Systems (from 2017). He received an IEEE Signal Processing Society 1999 Best Paper Award and 
several Best Paper Awards at International Conferences. He is a recipient of the International Neural 
Networks Society INNS 2000 Young Investigator Award for significant contributions in the field of neural 
networks. He has served as a Director and Organizer of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Learning 
Theory and Practice (Leuven 2002), as a program co-chair for the International Joint Conference on 
Neural Networks 2004 and the International Symposium on Nonlinear Theory and its Applications 2005, as 
an organizer of the International Symposium on Synchronization in Complex Networks 2007, a co-organizer 
of the NIPS 2010 workshop on Tensors, Kernels and Machine Learning, and chair of ROKS 2013. He has 
been awarded an ERC Advanced Grant 2011 and has been elevated IEEE Fellow 2015 for developing least 
squares support vector machines.
