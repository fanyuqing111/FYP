Biography 
Dylan Lu received his BEng(Hons) and PhD degrees in Electronic and Information 
Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 1999 and 2004 
respectively. 
 
From 2002 to 2003, he served as a Research Student Trainee with Newton Power Limited. In 
2003, he joined PowereLab Limited as a Senior Design Engineer. His major responsibilities 
include project development and management, customized circuit design, and contribution of 
research in the area of power electronics. In 2006, he joined the School of Electrical and 
Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, Australia, as a Lecturer where he was 
promoted to Associate Professor in 2016. He now holds an honorary position at the University 
of Sydney. From July 2013 to December 2013, he was with the University of Hong Kong as an 
Visiting Associate Professor. Currently, he is with the School of Electrical and Data 
Engineering, University of Technology Sydney as an Associate Professor. 
 
He has published extensively in the area of power electronics. He holds two patents. His current 
research interests include power electronics circuits and control for efficient power conversion, 
power factor correction, consumer electronics, motor drives, renewable electrical energy 
systems, microgrid and grid-integration issues, and engineering education. He serves currently as 
an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, and 
the IET Renewable Power Generation. He is a member of the IEAust and a senior member of 
the IEEE.
