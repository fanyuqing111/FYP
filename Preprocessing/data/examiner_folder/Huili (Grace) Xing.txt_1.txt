Summary
Dr. Xing is a Richard Lunquist Sesquicentennial Professor at Cornell University, with a 
50/50 joint appointment with the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the 
Department of Materials Science & Engineering. She was with Electrical Engineering at the 
University of Notre Dame (UND) from 2004 to 2014, after earning her Ph.D. and 
subsequent one-year postdoctoral experience in Electrical and Computer Engineering from 
the University of California, Santa Barbara.  During her research career, she has received the 
Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research 
(AFOSR) in October 2008, the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award in 
January 2009, the John Cardinal O'Hara C.S.C. professorship by the University of Notre 
Dame in 2010, the Young Scientist Award at the International Symposium on Compound 
Semiconductors (ISCS) in 2014.  She is also the advisor to a recipient of the 2013 Eli J. and 
Helen Shaheen Graduate School Award in Engineering at UND, several best paper awards, 
including a Best Paper Award at International Workshop on Nitride Semiconductors (IWN) 
and the Best Student Presentation Award at IRMMW-THz in 2012.
Xing’s research and teaching interests are in the area of electronic materials and devices.  Her 
research projects involve growth, fabrication and characterization of semiconductor electronic 
and optical materials and devices, primarily III-V nitride semiconductors, 2D crystals and 
tunnel FETs.  She is the author or co-author of 150+ journal articles, 70+ conference 
proceeding papers and 300+ conference presentations, delivered 80+ invited talks and 
contributed five chapters in five books.  Her h-index is 36 with 4700+ citations according to 
Google Scholar.
She currently advises 6 graduate students, 3 postdoctoral researchers, co-advises a few 
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and collaborate closely with 1 Research 
Assistant Professor (RAP).  She also worked closely with 2 RAPs at the Electrical 
Engineering Department, one of whom was promoted to a tenure-track assistant professor at 
UND in 2011.  Nine students have been awarded Ph.D. degree, and five M.S. degrees have 
been awarded under her supervision.  Since Fall 2004, her research efforts have been 
supported by about $60M in external research funding, with Xing serving as the leading 
principle investigator on over $12M.
