Zicheng Liu received his Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University in 1996. He got his
B.S. degree in mathematics from HuaZhong Normal University, Wuhan, China, in 1984, and his
M.S. in Operations Research from the Institute of Applied Mathematics, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, in 1989. Before joining Microsoft Research, he worked at Silicon Graphics, Inc. as a
member of technical staff for two years, where he developed the trimmed NURBS
tessellator shipped in both OpenGL and the OpenGL Optimizer.
Current research interests include human activity recognition, 3D face modeling and animation,
and multimedia signal processing. He has worked on a variety of topics including Steiner trees,
average case complexity, linked figure animation, and trimmed NURBS tessellation for large
CAD model visualization.
Liu has served in the technical committee for many international conferences. He was a
member of the Audio and Electroacoustics Committee of IEEE Signal Processing Society. He is
the chair of the Multimedia Systems and Applications Technical Committee of IEEE CAS society.
He is a steering committee member of IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. He is the Editor-in-
Chief of Journal of Visual Communications and Image Representation, and an associate editor
