SHORT BIO: 
Dr. Ronggui Yang is the S.P. Chip and Lori Johnson Faculty Fellow and a Professor of Mechanical 
Engineering directing the Nano-enabled Energy Conversion, Storage, 
and Thermal 
Management 
Systems group (NEXT) at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder). Dr. Yang is also a Faculty 
Fellow for the Materials Science and Engineering Program and a Faculty Affiliate for the CU/NREL 
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute at CU-Boulder. Dr. Yang received his Ph.D degree focusing 
on Nanoscale Heat Transfer with Professor Gang Chen in Mechanical Engineering and Professor 
Mildred S. Dresselhaus in Physics and Electrical Engineering from MIT in February 2006. Since January 
2006, he started his faculty career as an Assistant Professor at CU-Boulder and has been promoted to 
Associate Professor (two-years ahead of normal tenure clock) in summer 2011 and to Full Professor in 
summer 2016. Prior to MIT, he had a Master’s degree in MEMS from UCLA in 2001, a Master’s degree 
in Engineering Thermophysics from Tsinghua University in Beijing in 1999, and a Bachelor’s degree in 
Thermal Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 1996. His research interests are on the 
fundamentals of nanoscale transport phenomena (thermal, electrical, thermoelectric, phase-change) and 
the applications of micro/nanotechnologies for thermal, energy and water systems. His notable 
contributions include developing multiscale simulation framework for thermal and thermoelectric 
transport in nanostructured materials, the first experimental demonstration of quasi-ballistic phonon 
transport using ultrafast pump-and-probe method with soft X-ray, and most recently on the development 
of hybrid micro/nano-structured surfaces for phase-change heat transfer enhancement. Dr. Ronggui Yang 
has published ~120 journal papers, delivered ~80 invited seminars and is associated with >140 invited 
and contributed conference talks and posters that garnered numerous best paper/presentation/poster 
awards. His journal papers are highly cited, with an H-index of 30, a total citation > 4500 times as of 
December 30, 2016, and an annual citation > 800 times per ISI Web of Science since 2015 (an H-Index 
of 37, a total citation > 7000 times as of December 30, 2016, and an annual citation > 1200 times since 
2015, per Google Scholar).  His innovative research has won him numerous awards including the 2014 
ITS Young Investigator in Thermoelectrics from International Thermoelectric Society (ITS), the 2010 
ASME Bergles-Rohsenow Young Investigator Award in Heat Transfer, an NSF CAREER Award in 
2009, the MIT Technology Review’s TR35 Award and the DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2008, the 
2005 Goldsmid Award for Research Excellence in Thermoelectrics by a Graduate Student from ITS, and 
a NASA Tech Brief Award for a Technical Innovation in 2004. He has also won the Provost’s 
Achievement Award (2012), the Dean’s Performance Award (2010), the Woodward Outstanding Faculty 
of Mechanical Engineering (2011) and the Outstanding Research Award in Mechanical Engineering 
(2008) from the University of Colorado Boulder. He was endowed with the S.P. Chip and Lori Johnson 
Faculty Fellow for 2013-2017 and the Sanders Faculty Fellow for 2008-2012. Dr. Yang is also well 
recognized for his professional services. Dr. Yang is currently the Chair (2015-2017) and the Founding 
Vice-Chair (2012-2015) of the K-9 Technical Committee on Nanoscale Thermal Transport of ASME 
Heat Transfer Division. In 2015, Dr. Yang is elected a Fellow of ASME. He is also an Associate Editor 
for ASME Journal of Heat Transfer and and Associate Editor for Heat Transfer Research published by 
Begell House Inc.
