Career History 
Director of Cambridge Nano Doctoral Training Centre: 
         
        2009- current 
Leading £8M training centre for >50 PhD students across Chemistry, Engineering, 
Physics and Materials, in Nano-Assembly of Functional Materials & Devices. 
Head of NanoPhotonics Centre: University of Cambridge, UK 
        2007- current 
Appointed to new senior chair at the Cavendish Labs, starting up a new research 
activity in NanoPhotonics, with Portfolio and Programme grant funding. 
Founder/Researcher:  Mesophotonics Ltd.  
 
 
             2001- 2008 
NanoPhotonics spin-off company from research on photonic crystals, based at 
the Southampton Science Park. Seed funding of £2.8M raised in 2001. Second 
round funding raised $10M in 2004. Taiwan labs (2006) and bought by UniLite. 
Director of Nano:  
University of Southampton, UK 
     
     
2000- 2007 
Led Nano strategic theme across the University, pump-priming new groups, 
fostering inter-disciplinary research, and developing fabrication facilities. 
Founded NanoMaterials Forum, jointly funded by industry, linking diverse groups. 
Professor:  
University of Southampton, UK 
 
     
    
1998- 2007 
Joint chair in departments of Physics & Astronomy and Electronics & Computer 
Science heading a new initiative focussed on the properties of meso- and nano-
scale physics and technology. Co-director of EPSRC NanoPhotonics Portfolio 
Centre from 2005, and developed NanoMaterials Platform.
