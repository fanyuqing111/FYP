Professor Clive Roberts - Professor of Railway Systems
• PhD in Electronic and Electrical Engineering (University of Birmingham)  
• BEng (Hons) in Electronics (University of Wales, Cardiff)  
• MIET
Clive graduated from the University of Wales, Cardiff with a BEng (Hons) in Electronics in
1996. He then went on to work at Lucas Aerospace in Birmingham as a Software
Engineer for just over a year.  
In 1997 he joined the University of Birmingham as a Research Fellow and began working
on projects looking at railway condition monitoring of railway infrastructure assets.  
In 2001 he became a Lecturer. In 2007 he was promoted to the role of Senior Research
Fellow and took on the role of Director of Research for the Birmingham Centre for
Railway Research and Education. In 2010 he became Professor of Railway Systems.
