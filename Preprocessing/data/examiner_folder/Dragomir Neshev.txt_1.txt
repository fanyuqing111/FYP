(third year) teaching 10 lectures and 2 tutorials.
• Supervision: Supervised a large number of students, including 44 students at a postgraduate
level: 34 PhD (17 full time and 17 for an average of 6 months) and 10 MSc (6 full time and 4
for an average of 3 months), as well as 17 students at undergraduate (Honours and BSc) level.
Currently I supervise six PhD students (three as a principal supervisor and three as a scientific
advisor). I am also the principle supervisor of three postdoctoral research fellows.
