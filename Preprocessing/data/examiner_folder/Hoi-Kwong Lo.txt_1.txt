and engineers alike. This is the only course in quantum information that is being 
offered by the University of Toronto. 
 
 
*Obtained Certificate on “Mastering the Craft of University Teaching” from the 
Office of Teaching Advancement at the University of Toronto (2005). 
 
C. Training of highly qualified personnel 
 
Training of highly qualified persons is an important part of Lo’s research program. 
He attracted top students from top universities such as Oxford University, 
Imperial College London, Peking University and the University of Toronto. Those 
trainees’ have figured prominently in the achievements of the group. His postdocs 
and students have won a number of honours/recognition. For instance, his former 
postdoc, Dr. Kai Chen has won an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation 
Fellowship in Germany. Four of his current and former group members (J. C. 
Boileau, F. Dupuis, F. Fung, and Y. Zhao) have won NSERC postdoctoral 
fellowships. Furthermore, three of his former group members have already 
secured long-term positions. Dr. Kiyoshi Tamaki is currently a permanent
