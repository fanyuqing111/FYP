Overview
Research
Dr McGrath ’s research addresses fundamental questions concerning the modulation and 
control of power electronic conversion systems. He has made a significant contribution to 
the understanding of multilevel converters, including the fundamental modulation principles 
and dynamic control problems such as natural balancing mechanisms. Particular research 
interests include:
Modulation theory for power electronic systems.
