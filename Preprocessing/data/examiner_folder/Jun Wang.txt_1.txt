Chair Professor
Jun Wang is a Chair Professor of Computational Intelligence in the Department of Computer 
Science at City University of Hong Kong. Prior to this position, he held various academic positions 
at Dalian University of Technology, Case Western Reserve University, University of North Dakota, 
and Chinese University of Hong Kong. He also held various part-time visiting positions at US Air 
Force Armstrong Laboratory, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Huazhong University of Science and 
Technology, Dalian University of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a Changjiang 
Chair Professor. He received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering and an M.S. degree in systems 
engineering from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China. He received his Ph.D. degree in 
systems engineering from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. His current 
research interests include neural networks and their applications. He published about 200 journal 
papers, 15 book chapters, 11 edited books, and numerous conference papers in these areas. He is 
the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics. He also served as an Associate Editor 
of the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks (1999-2009), IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics and 
its predecessor (2003-2013), and IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics – Part C 
(2002–2005), as a member of the editorial advisory board of International Journal of Neural 
Systems (2006-2013), and a member of the editorial board of Neural Networks (2012-2014) as a 
guest editor of special issues of European Journal of Operational Research (1996), International 
Journal of Neural Systems (2007), Neurocomputing (2008, 2014, 2016), and International Journal of 
Fuzzy Systems (2010, 2011). He was an organizer of several international conferences such as the 
General Chair of the 13th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (2006) and 
the 2008 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence, and a Program Chair of the IEEE 
International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (2012). He has been an IEEE 
Computational Intelligence Society Distinguished Lecturer (2010-2012, 2014-2016). In addition, he 
served as President of Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly (APNNA) in 2006 and many 
organizations such as IEEE Fellow Committee (2011-2012); IEEE Computational Intelligence 
Society Awards Committee (2008, 2012, 2014), IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society 
Board of Directors (2013-2015), He is an IEEE Fellow, IAPR Fellow, and a recipient of an IEEE 
Transactions on Neural Networks Outstanding Paper Award and APNNA Outstanding Achievement 
Award in 2011, Natural Science Awards from Shanghai Municipal Government (2009) and Ministry 
of Education of China (2011), and Neural Networks Pioneer Award from IEEE Computational 
Intelligence Society (2014), among others.
