Research Interests 
His research group focuses on atomic-scale characterization, design, and synthesis as well as properties of 
advanced materials including 2D materials and soft matter by means of aberration-corrected transmission 
electron microscopy and spectroscopy. In situ experiments at both the atomic and nano scales are 
implemented for his work. He has co-authored over 100 peer-reviewed publications and given over 40 
invited presentations on topics such as structure and defects of 2D materials, deformation mechanism of 
nanocrystalline metals and thin films, and imaging of soft matter for materials science research.
