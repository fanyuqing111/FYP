Research interests
Martijn de Sterke is a theoretical physicist, whose approach to his research is 
characterized by actively seeking collaborations with experimentalists. He has authored 
papers in the fields of optics and photonics, solid state physics, and acoustics, and these 
papers have appeared both in the physics and in the engineering literature. In optics he 
has worked on a variety of problems in the areas of nonlinear optics (soliton physics, 
nonlinear propagation, numerical methods, optical frequency conversion, parametric 
amplification), wave propagation in random media, guided-wave optics, coupling of co- 
and contra-propagating modes in one-dimensional periodic media, photonic crystals, 
microstructured optical fibres, self-written gratings and waveguides, and optical Bloch 
oscillations. Highlights of his publication record include: development of the theory of 
grating solitons, including the coupling of these solitons, the nonlinear theory of deep 
gratings; first experimental verification of these solitons, and the definitive experimental 
paper; definitive paper on the theory of Hill gratings; theory and first observation of self-
writing of waveguides in glass; first calculation of local density of states in realistic 
photonic crystals for determining radiation dynamics; first study of birefringence, structural 
losses and the nature of modal cut-offs in microstructured optical fibres; first calculation of 
the modes of microstructured optical fibres with high-index inclusions; first general theory 
of frequency conversion in two-dimensionally poled structures, and the general 
optimization of these poling patterns; first general theory of dynamic localization in 
semiconductors under an applied uniform AC fields; and proposal and experimental 
verification of grating-dispersion inverted interference devices.
