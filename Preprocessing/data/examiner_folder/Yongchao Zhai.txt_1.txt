Yongchao Zhai, Ph.D., Associate Professor at the Xi’an University 
of Architecture and Technology, Department of Architecture.
<songchao.zhai@gmail.com>, <songchaozhai@gmail.com>
His research interests include thermal comfort, perceived air quality, 
air movement, laboratory and field test methods, personal comfort 
systems, natural ventilation and energy efficiency in buildings.
Yongchao received a BS in Architectural Design from Shandong University in 2006, 
and a Ph.D. in Building Science from South China University of Technology in 2013. 
While working on his Ph.D., Yongchao spent two years as a visiting student 
researcher at Center of Built Environment, University of California, Berkeley, where 
he became a Postdoctoral Researcher after receiving his Ph.D.. His research focuses
on air movement and comfort in hot-humid environments, gender differences in 
thermal comfort and outdoor thermal environment monitoring in cities in hot-humid 
climate.
