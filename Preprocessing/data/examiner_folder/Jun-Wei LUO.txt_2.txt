Description: I currently focus on theoretical prediction and design of semiconductor information materials for semiconductor optoelectronic
(quantum) integrated circuit technologies. I had made several major research achievements, such as systematically studying the
optical emission mechanism in Silicon quantum dots and designing multiples schemes of high efficient Silicon-based lighting
materials to overcome the world-wide challenge of on-chip light source; revealing the mechanisms of interfacial charge transfer and
of dopant diffusions in semiconductor devices; uncovering novel mechanisms of spin-orbit coupling effect in conventional
semiconductor low-dimensional systems; and proposing a textbook class theory of spin-orbit coupling. I published more than 50
peer-reviewed papers, including 5 on nature sister journals and 5 on PRL. I was invited to talk or service as a session chair in
prestigious international conferences such as APS, ACS, E-MRS, JSAP-MRS and ICSNN.
