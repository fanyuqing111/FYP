Biographical Summary of Minyue Fu
Professor Minyue Fu is a leading researcher in control systems at the international level.
He is also well recognised for cross-disciplinary research in signal processing and communica-
tions. In his research career spanning 30 years, he has published over 440 papers in referred
international journals and conferences with over 7500 citations and h-index of 41 (Scopus).
He was elected as an IEEE Fellow in late 2003, with the citation for contributions to robust
control and signal estimation. He has been a key participant (Chief Investigator and Associate
Director) of several special research centres funded by Australian Research Council. He has
been a Chief Investigator of 14 major Australian Research Council research grants. He has
supervised over 50 Ph.D. students and 20 research fellows, and has wide collaborations with
researchers in USA, Singapore, China and Brazil, including Changjiang Visiting Professor
at Shandong University and Distinguished Scholar at Zhejiang University and Guangdong
University of Technology, China.
Professor Fu’s current research interests are in networked control systems, multi-agent
systems and optimization. Cooperative control systems involving wired and wireless commu-
nication networks are revolutionizing the applications of control theory. Examples of such
systems range from smart electricity grids to traffic networks. These systems pose serious
challenges for control design methods which have traditionally relied on perfect communica-
tion information. Not only new control theories are required, control-oriented communication
paradigms also need to be developed. Fu’s background in control, optimization, signal pro-
cessing and communications plays an important role in this cross-disciplinary research.
Samples of his research outcomes include: Pioneering work in switching adaptive control
which provides key ingredients for the so-called supervisory control theory popularly used
in controlling complex dynamic systems; Major contributions in robust control theory and
robust signal estimation; New design techniques for the so-called dual-stage control systems for
super-precise, high-speed positioning with applications in high-resolution imaging, precision
manufacturing and nano-technology; New methods for quantizer design for networked control
systems; and cross-disciplinary work in communications by applying systems theory to model
turbo codes and multi-channel wireless communication systems.
Professor Fu’s managerial experience includes 7.5 years as a Head of School/Department
and 8 years as an Associate Director of two Australian Research Council Centres of Excellence.
In the role as a Head of School/Department, he led his academic unit through two major
restructures in the University, ensuring major expansion in research activities and establishing
innovative inshore and offshore teaching programs. In the role as the Associate Director,
he was a chief investigator and key managerial figure in several prestigious research centres,
leading a large program in signal processing and supervising many industrial research projects.
In relation to internationalization of tertiary education, Professor Fu’s main experi-
ence includes the startup of a new offshore academic program in Singapore for the Univer-
sity of Newcastle for the Bachelor Degrees of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering,
Telecommunications and partly in Mechatronics. This program, known as UoN-PSB pro-
gram, was established in 2000 as a partnership tertiary education program in conjunction
with the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board (PSB). Fu’s involvement, as the Head
of Department of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, was to establish the
3.5 academic degree programs in Singapore, managing the academic staff and administrative
staff to carry out the required offshore teaching, quality control activities as well as the re-
lated financial matters. This program became very successful and led to the establishment
of a major campus in Singapore known as UoN Singapore, offering a wide range of offshore
tertiary programs in Singapore for the University of Newcastle.
