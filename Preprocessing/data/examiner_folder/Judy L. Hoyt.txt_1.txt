Biography: 
Judy L. Hoyt is a Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT. Dr. Hoyt 
received the B.S. degree in Physics and Applied Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley 
in 1981, and the Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics from Stanford University in December, 1987. From 1988 
through 1999 Dr. Hoyt was a Senior Research Scientist in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. In 
January 2000, she joined the faculty at MIT in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer 
Science. She is presently serving as Associate Director within the Microsystems Technology Laboratories 
(MTL).
