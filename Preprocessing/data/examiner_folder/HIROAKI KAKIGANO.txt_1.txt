■Research summary
Power electronics for power system applications
  Electrical energy is essential for our society, and ‘Power Electronics’ plays an important role to use the 
electrical energy effectively because it is deeply related to generation, storage, supply and usage. Our 
laboratory researches the power electronics applications in power supply systems for high stability, high 
quality and high efficiency. We can get fully understanding of power electronics and power system 
engineering through these research activities.
