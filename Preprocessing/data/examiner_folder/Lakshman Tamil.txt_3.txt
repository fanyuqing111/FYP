Optical Society Recognizes Profs Research 
Successes 
Two UT Dallas faculty members have been 
elected fellows of the Optical Society of 
America for their pioneering work in 
decidedly high-tech areas of the field of 
optics. Dr. Duncan MacFarlane was 
recognized for his “contributions to 
advancing integrated optics and their 
applications, including photonic filters, 
advanced displays and micro-optics.” Dr. Lakshman Tamil was 
recognized “for significant contributions to the design and 
development of multi-terabit switches using photonic-electronic 
hybrid sub-wavelength switching.” Both are professors of 
electrical engineering in the University’s Erik Jonsson School of 
Engineering and Computer Science.
