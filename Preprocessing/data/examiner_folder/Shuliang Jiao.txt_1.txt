CREATIVE WORK   
 The breakthrough technology, visible-light OCT based rhodopsin molecular contrast imaging 
of the retina, is promising to provide functional mapping of the rod photoreceptors. It has 
potential significant impact in the diagnosis of major blinding diseases like age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). It also provides a functional 
outcome measure for regenerative treatment of the degenerative retinal diseases, such as stem 
cell therapy and gene therapy. The technology was highlighted in Medical News 
(http://www.medicalnewsinc.com/clinical/article/20359500/imaging-rhodopsin-could-shed-
light-on-retinal-disorders-in-joint-project-between-bascom-palmer-eye-institute-and-florida-
international-university) and Review of Ophthalmology 
(http://www.reviewofophthalmology.com/content/t/imaging_and_diagnostic_instruments/c/57

 My lab invented a new imaging technology termed “optical coherence photoacoustic 
microscopy” (OC-PAM), which can accomplish the functions of OCT and photoacoustic 
microscopy (PAM) simultaneously by using a single illuminating light source. In OC-PAM, 
each laser pulse generates both one OCT A-line and one PAM A-line simultaneously; as a 
result, the two imaging modalities are intrinsically registered in the lateral directions. Since 
the OC-PAM images are provided by the same photons it may provide an unprecedented 
platform for the study of optical absorption and scattering in biological tissues. The 
technology was achieved with three different designs: using a pulsed broadband laser 
centered at 580 nm, using a NIR pulsed broadband laser centered at 800 nm, and using 
modulated continuous wave SLD light source centered at 840 nm. The invention has been 
awarded an US patent (US 9,442,095 B2). The work was also reported in SPIE Newsroom 
(http://spie.org/newsroom/4580-watching-while-listening-to-the-interaction-of-photons-with-
bio-tissues). 
 We were the first to use home-made ultrahigh resolution spectral-domain OCT to study the 
retinal structures of birds of prey in vivo. The study was published in the journal 
Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science. The publication was highlighted in Science 
Daily in July 2010. (High-Resolution Imaging Expands Vision Research of Live Birds of 
Prey, http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100721133229.htm). 
 We invented the algorithms for constructing retinal fundus image, which solved the problem 
of OCT image registration. The technology was awarded a patent (US patent 7,301,644) and 
licensed to Carl Zeiss Meditech in 2005. The technology was also highlighted in 
Ophthalmology Times in May 2005. (Three-dimensional spectral-domain OCT solves 
problem of precise spatial registration.

Visible-light OCT-based quantitative multimodal retina imaging 
Project period: 03-01-2017 to 02-28-2022 
Total direct cost: $2,497,176 
Retinal degenerative disorders and glaucoma are major causes of visual disability. We propose 
new multimodal imaging technologies based on a visible-light optical coherence tomography 
platform to quantitatively image the distribution of lipofuscin, a nondegradable lipid/protein 
aggregates accumulated in the retinal pigment epithelium, and the spectral reflectance of the 
retinal nerve fiber layer. These novel imaging technologies will add a significant clinical tool for 
diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of retinal degenerative disorders and glaucoma, and will have a 
great impact on patient care and clinical trials for potential treatments.

Integrated Multidisciplinary Strategies for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathies

thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) plays in retinal vascular homeostasis and vasculopathies associated 
with diabetes. The proposed studies will be carried out in a unique mouse model of diabetic 
retinopathy (Akita/+ TSP1-/-), which develops an extensive array of diabetic retinopathies 
(including acellular capillaries and saccular microaneurysms) and truly replicates the 
pathological response seen in humans.
