<horace.mui@polyu.edu.hk>  
 
Brief 
Dr. Mui K.W. is the Associate Professor in the Department of Building Services Engineering of The Hong Kong 
Polytechnic University. He obtained a BEng (Hons, First Class) degree and a PhD specializing in building 
environmental performance from the BSE Department at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU). He joined 
the HKPU as a faculty member since 2000. Currently, he is an honourable international advisor for Hong Kong Indoor 
Air Quality Society, founding member and the co-chairman of the Technical Working Group (TWG) of ASHRAE HK 
Chapter. 
  
Dr. Mui has been deeply and energetically involved in the research and development. He gained 2 patents and 
technology research funds from the RGC of the HKSAR Government, the University, and other resources. In 2008, a 
new class II IAQ bioaerosol laboratory has been funded under his initiative; it is an IAQ (bioaerosol) research 
milestone in BSE. In the past few years, major works of him, including about 100 referred journal papers (SCI & EI) on 
IAQ assessment, performance of the new demand control ventilation system, drainage systems of domestic high-rise 
buildings, water consumption, performance of deodorizer systems, adaptive comfort temperature model for air-
conditioned buildings and certain advanced areas of building environmental performance, have been published. 
Besides, two of his papers has recently been recognized amongst the most cited articles published in Elsevier's 
Building and Environment between 2005 and 2008. 
  
Ir. Dr. Mui’s extensive research experiences have led him to a number of high-level consultancy projects. On behalf of 
the Department, he performed presentations and shared his research findings in journals, conferences, forums and 
invited workshops all over the world. He also offered community services to organizations serving the underprivileged. 
With his past experience, he is invited as a group member to work in the working group WG6 on perceived air quality.
