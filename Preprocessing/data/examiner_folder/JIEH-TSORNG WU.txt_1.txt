JIEH-TSORNG WU
PROFESSOR, NATIONAL CHIAO-TUNG UNIVERSITY
About
Jieh-Tsorng Wu was born in Taipei, Taiwan.  He received 
the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from National 
Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan, in 1980, and the M.S. and 
Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford 
University, Stanford, CA, in 1983 and 1988, respectively.
From 1980 to 1982 he served in the Chinese Army as a Radar 
Technical Officer.  From 1982 to 1988, at Stanford University, 
he focussed his research on high-speed analog-to-digital 
conversion in CMOS VLSI.  From 1988 to 1992 he was a 
Member of Technical Staff at Hewlett-Packard Microwave 
Semiconductor Division in San Jose, CA, and was 
responsible for several linear and digital giga-hertz IC designs.  Since 1992, he has been with 
the Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, 
where he is now a Professor. His current research interests are high-performance mixed-
signal integrated circuits.
Dr. Wu is a Fellow of the IEEE. He has served as an Associate Editor of the IEEE Journal of 
Solid-State Circuits (JSSC) and a technical program subcommittee member of the IEEE 
International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC). Dr. Wu is also a member of Phi Tau Phi.
