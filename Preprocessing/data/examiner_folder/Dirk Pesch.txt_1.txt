RESEARCH 
RESEARCH EXPERTISE
EXPERTISE 
My research focuses on the study, design and performance evaluation of communication protocols 
and system architectures for ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things and Cyber-
Physical Systems and their applications to smart, energy efficient buildings and sustainable cities and 
assisted living as well as smart manufacturing.  
I have a strong track record in securing research funding, having secured as lead PI or co-PI in excess 
of €15M in funding from Irish and European funding agencies and directly from industry. I am a co-PI 
in the SFI CONNECT Centre for Future Networks, where my focus is on sustainable IoT and 
dependable networks. I am also a co-PI in the SFI funded ENABLE research programme on IoT and 
data analytics for smart cities and communities applications, where my research is focused on IoT 
applications in smart buildings, cities and assisted living. I am a co-PI in the SFI funded CONFIRM 
Centre, where I am studying industrial IoT and cyber-physical system applications for smart 
manufacturing. Most recently, I have become the director of the SFI funded Centre for Research 
Training in Advanced Networks for Sustainable Societies, a new national initiative to train at least 120 
PhD students in future networks and IoT for smart cities and communities. 
Over the past nearly 20 years I have made a number of scientific contributions and built applied 
research capability in the area of embedded wireless networked systems (Internet of Things/Cyber-
physical systems) with applications in telecommunications, the built environment, sustainable living, 
and assistive technologies. I have published widely (over 200 peer reviewed publications), have a h-
index of 28 with over 2500 citations.

HISTORY OF MENTORING
HISTORY OF MENTORING 
I have a significant track record of mentoring/supervision of research Masters/PhD students, 
postdoctoral researchers, junior academic staff. I supervise/mentor to empower graduate students 
to become independent researchers, to support postdoctoral researchers and junior academic 
colleagues to grow into future research leaders and mentors themselves. I have previously 
supervised/mentored 10 postdoctoral staff who are now either in academic leadership roles 
themselves or have joined industry. I am in the process of building a group focused on Internet of 
Things research topics at UCC and am recruiting 5 new PhD students and 4 new research staff.

COMMERCIALISATION AND KNOWEDGE TRANSFER
COMMERCIALISATION AND KNOWEDGE TRANSFER 
I have a strong track record of research commercialisation and knowledge transfer. I am the 
academic director of the Enterprise Ireland supported Technologies for Embedded Computing (TEC) 
Gateway, the Nimbus Centre’s industry interface, an initiative which aims at exploiting academic 
research for commercialisation with and knowledge transfer into industry. Most of my past and 
current research projects involve active collaboration with industry which naturally includes 
knowledge transfer of our research into those companies. I have filed over 15 invention disclosures 
with the CIT Technology Transfer Office over the past 10 years. Two of the invention disclosures 
formed the basis for technology evaluation licenses to Intel Ireland and Honeywell Prague 
Laboratory. I have been awarded a patent on wireless indoor localisation and tracking technology 
and recently filed a patent on Internet of Things interoperability for home automation systems in 
conjunction with a collaborator from Arris. I also have a share in two CIT start-ups, ShowGuider and 
PCS, where I act as a scientific advisor and support/advise them in seeking Enterprise Ireland and EU 
funding. I have been collaborating with a large number of Irish SMEs such as Amocom, Benetel, Cylon 
Controls, ServusNet, EuroTech, EpiSensor, SmartFactory, Firmwave and multinational companies 
based in Ireland and abroad including Intel, IBM, UTRC, Bilfinger, Nokia Bell Labs, Bord Gais, 
Schneider Electric, Philips, EMC, Arris, Alstom, Atos, etc. The collaborations are funded by both Irish 
and EU agencies as well as directly by the industry partner. I also collaborate with Cork City and Cork 
County Councils and am a steering group member of the Cork Smart Gateway Initiative. 
ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES
ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES 
I am on the editorial board of Springer Wireless Networks, MDPI Sensors Journal and the 
International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks. Previously I was an editorial board member of 
the IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine, Elsevier Pervasive and Mobile Computing and Elsevier Ad-
hoc Networks.  
I am also active in conference organisation as member of the Technical Programme Committee of a 
large number of leading ACM and IEEE conferences. Most recently, I am co-chair of the Industrial IoT 
track for the IEEE World-Forum for the IoT in 2019.
