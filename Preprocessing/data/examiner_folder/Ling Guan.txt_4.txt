RE: [MANANDHAR DIPU(G1401564C)] - (Thesis Initiation Nomination of Examiners(PhD) 
Form) submitted by Yap Kim Hui 
Dear Wati, 
 
The reason is because the thesis contains confidential information involving work done by the candidate on an 
RCA with a Chinese company called VIPSHOP. 
The project is partly funded by VIPSHOP and the signed RCA includes clauses on confidential information. 
 
Regards, 
Kim Hui
