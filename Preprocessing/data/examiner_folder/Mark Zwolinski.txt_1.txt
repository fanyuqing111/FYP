Curriculum Vitae: 
Mark Zwolinski received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 
1982 and 1986, respectively. From 1990 to 2005, he was a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, and Reader in the School of 
Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, and since 2005, he has been a Full Professor. His 
current research interests include electronic design automation, low-power and reliable design, and multicore 
platforms. He has published over 140 refereed journal and conference papers and is the author of three books. Dr. 
Zwolinski has served on the Technical Program Committees of many conferences including DAC, DATE, and ETS, 
and was the Technical Program Chair for ICECS 2007. He is a Fellow of the IET and of BCS and a Senior Member 
of ACM.
