RESEARCH EXPERIENCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
Extensive research experiences in robotics and cell­based bioengineering, with numerous outcomes in
both fundamental and applied researches. Obtain HK$ 50M research founding and lead more than 30
research projects towards successful completion. Particular academic contributions include:
Leading researches in robotic single cell manipulation, focusing on development of cell
manipulation tools with optical tweezers for probing cell functional mechanism. Make
breakthrough researches in cell­based bioengineering at single cell level, developing table­top
engineering solutions with integrated technologies in robotics & automation, optical tweezers,
microfluidic chip and biomedical engineering.
Deep investigation in multiagent systems. Design, create and apply synchronization approaches
and other multiagent approaches to multirobot coordination, CNC machining, robot formation
networks and multi­cell manipulations.
Extensive researches in advanced robotics and mechatronics. Technology transfer and
development of a high­tech start up in Hong Kong Science Park. Actively involved in collaboration
research with industry in motion controls and automation product technologies.
Cell­based Bioengineering: Pioneered works on developing robot­aided cell manipulation system with
optical tweezers. Cell manipulations include cell stretching, cell positioning, cell sorting and isolation, cell
fusion and cell injection etc. Current studies focus on bioengineering solutions at single cell level to
characterize nanobiomechanics property of biological cells, understanding cell mechanism and
functional behaviors through researches in cell­to­cell interaction and cell migration control in micro­fluid
channels. Currently lead one on­going CRF (Collaboration Research Fund) as Project Coordinator and
participate one TRS (Theme­based Research Scheme) project and one CRF project as Co­PI.
Multirobot System: Creatively designed a cross­coupling synchronization control framework to control
both position and synchronization errors to converge to zero. The research exhibited large potential in
applications with multiagent and networked systems. The method has been applied to multirobot
