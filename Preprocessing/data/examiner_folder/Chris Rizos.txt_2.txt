Short Resume
of the position, research interests, and activities related to the IUGG
of Prof. Dr. Chris Rizos
Current Position:
Professor, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales, 
Sydney, Australia
Principal Research Interests:
My research interests since 1985 have been in the topic area of precise positioning using satellite-
based technology such as GPS, which has broadened in the last decade to encompass all GNSS. 
My major research contributions have been in developing algorithms, investigating 
methodologies and promoting applications of GNSS technology. With respect to the latter, my 
focus has been on geodetic and geospatial applications. This has led me to also serve the IAG 
since 2004 through my membership of the Governing Board and Executive of the International 
GNSS Service (IGS), one of the IAG’s services.
Activities related to IAG and IUGG
I have been engaged with IAG affairs since 1995, when I became chair of a Special Study Group. 
Over a period of almost 20 years I have served the IAG in a number of office bearer positions, 
from vice-president of one of the Sections, to president of Commission 4, then vice-president, 
and currently the IAG president for the term 2011-2015. I continue to have a close interest in 
IUGG affairs, in particular chairing a small committee to develop a draft of the IUGG Strategic 
Plan 2016-23.
