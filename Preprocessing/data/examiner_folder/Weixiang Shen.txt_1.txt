Biography
A/Prof. Weixiang Shen received his BEng., MEng., and PhD degrees all from 
Electrical Engineering. He worked in several universities as Lecturer, 
Associate Professor and Research Fellow in China, German, Singapore and 
Malaysia. He is currently an Associate Professor in Faculty of Science, 
Engineering and Technology at Swinburne University of Technology, 
Melbourne, Australia. Weixiang's research interests are (1) battery applied 
research and control strategy for electric vehicles(EVs), including battery 
capacity estimation, battery charging, battery sorting and balancing, battery 
energy and thermal management system as well as EV control, (2) integration 
of EVs and renewable energy systems (e.g. solar photovoltaic (PV) systems 
and wind systems) into conventional power systems, including the smart use 
of EV batteries in power systems (e.g. smart grid) and the analysis and 
improvement of system stability for power systems integrated with 
renewable energy systems. In these areas, he has published more than 70 
papers in referred journals and conference proceedings. In addition, he has 
actively sought research fund from various organizations and has been a 
principal investigators and co-investigators of many national, industrial and 
university sponsored projects for EV technology and solar PV system 
technology in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. Since 2002, Weixiang 
has been served as the reviewers of IEEE Transaction on Vehicular
