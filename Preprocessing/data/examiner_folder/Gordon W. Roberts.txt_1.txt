MOST SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS 
(Names in bold style indicate that they are or were a student/trainee under Prof. Roberts’ supervision). 
Prof. G. Roberts is involved in two separate but related areas of scholarly engineering 
activity; specifically, the design and synthesis of analog and mixed-signal integrated 
circuits using nanometer technologies, and methods to verify and test mixed-signal 
integrated circuits in large volume manufacturing. He has published over 200+ articles in 
leading Institute Of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) journals and conferences. 
Over his 25+-year career at McGill University, he has made a significant contribution to 
the field of electronic engineering. According to Google Scholar his h-index is a 
respectable 39 and his i10-index is 95. An h-index of 39 indicates that 39 papers are cited 
at least 39 times. Further analysis reveals that 50 papers are cited with more than 25 
citations and 9 papers have over 100 citations.  To further illustrate his impact on the 
field of electrical engineering, Fig. 1 below display the number of citations his work has 
garnered every year since 1991.  It is notable to note that since 2004 his work has 
consistently received more than 450 citations each year. 
Prof. Roberts has co-written seven textbooks, of which, the most significant one is: An 
Introduction to Mixed-Signal Test and Measurement by Oxford University Press, now in 
its second edition (2011) and is also translated into Chinese. This textbook provides the 
framework for test researchers to understand the general problem facing test engineering 
and how past test problems were solved. For the most part, test engineering is a system 
design endeavor, as it requires a multifaceted understanding of electronics, signal 
processing, robotics, mechanics and material science, combined with a sound 
understanding of economics. As the first introductory textbook of this kind, it has helped 
accelerate student understanding of this multi-billion dollar field and has helped to focus 
research around important industrial problems.  
Prof. Roberts made major contributions to the world-renown textbook on Microelectronic 
Circuits by Sedra and Smith. A textbook that has been used in the undergraduate 
electronics curriculum at McGill University for over 25 years, and continues to this day. 
Through a collaborative effort with Sedra and Roberts, a companion book on SPICE was 
developed and marketed with the main course textbook.  This book continues to be used 
in undergraduate programs around the world.  Today, some of the SPICE material has

been pulled into the main textbook of Sedra and Smith for various marketing reasons.  It 
is fair to say that Prof. Roberts contributed to this portion of this highly successful 
textbook and has influenced the education of over 1 million students worldwide (as 
indicated by Oxford University Press Web Site). 
The four most significant research publications in terms of the number of citations as 
listed by Google Scholar by Prof. Roberts are the following:

(citation count of 139). 
 
Prof. Roberts has other works that have citations higher than these but these are not listed 
here, as they are either textbooks or research works that he was not the lead author.  It is 
interesting to note that ref. [2] and [3] above is listed by the editorial board of the IEEE 
Transactions of Circuits and Systems to be ranked among the top-cited papers in their 
transactions since 1990 (see http://tcas2.polito.it/editor/top-cited-TCAS-II.htm). An 
extended version of ref. [1] also appeared in a related journal of the Transactions of 
Circuits and Systems and is also ranked to be in the top-cited papers since 1990 (see 
http://tcas1.polito.it/editor/top-cited-TCAS-I.htm). In addition, the next three papers can 
be found in the 25th and/or 35th Anniversary Compendium of Papers from the 
International Test Conference, 1970 – 1994, 1970-2004. All three papers were awarded a 
best paper or honorable mention paper prize, as indicated below:
