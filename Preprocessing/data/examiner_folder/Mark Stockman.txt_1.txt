Major Scientific Results:  
Mark I. Stockman is a pioneer of nanoplasmonics publishing his first results in this area in 1988, setting the 
foundations of the field and later having obtained groundbreaking results in it. His pioneering research in 
this area began with the introduction of the giant optical enhancement in fractal nanoclusters of plasmonic

metals. He was one of the co-authors in a fundamental paper (1992) that correctly predicted the spectrum of 
surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with a dramatic enhancement in the red/near-ir spectral region, 
which was instrumental in the discovery by K. Kneipp et al. (1999) of the single-molecule SERS, as 
acknowledged by the corresponding reference. Today SERS is a thriving field with many new phenomena 
and applications. 
In 1995-1996 he introduced localization of plasmonic eigenmodes and such universally accepted 
phenomenon as plasmonic near-field hot spots. This direction of research was further developed when in 
2001 he in collaboration with David Bergman showed that dark and bright plasmonic eigenmodes co-exist. 
He also showed that strongly-localized eigenmodes are necessarily dark. Thus it was established that the 
Anderson localization of surface plasmons does not play a role in far-field optics of nanoplasmonic systems 
but is very important and can be observed with near-field excitation, which is another fundamental result. 
These results constitute the fundamental basis of the contemporary nanoplasmonics. 
Starting from 2000, Mark Stockman published a series of pioneering results that, to a significant 
degree, determined the modern development of the field of nanooptics and nanoplasmonics. In 2000 he 
pioneered the field of ultrafast nanoplasmonics with his Phys. Rev. Lett. article predicting giant ultrafast 
fluctuations (the “Ninth Wave Effect”) of nanoplasmonic local fields. In 2003 he with co-authors 
introduced coherent control of ultrafast localization on nanoscale, another milestone of the ultrafast 
nanoplasmonics. This development allowed for a very accurate control of optical energy with a nanometer 
resolution in space and with a femtosecond precision in time. This breakthrough work has initiated a 
significant field of scientific research; in particular it has stimulated Focus Program “Ultrafast Nanooptics” 
of German Science Foundation (2009). 
In 2003, Mark Stockman in collaboration with David Bergman set foundation of quantum 
nanoplasmonics with a seminal article introducing the spaser [D. J. Bergman and M. I. Stockman, Surface 
Plasmon Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation: Quantum Generation of Coherent Surface 
Plasmons in Nanosystems, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 027402-1-4 (2003)]. Simultaneously, they filed a patent 
application for spaser; a US patent No. 7,569,188 for spaser was issued in 2009. The spaser is a nanoscale 
quantum generator of local plasmonic fields, which are intense and ultrafast. The spaser is also a quantum 
amplifier: it is about the same size and with similar gain as the most common and most important 
microelectronic active element, MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor). Importantly, 
the spaser is approximately 1000 times faster than the MOSFET The spaser is the previously “missing” 
active element of nanoplasmonics that possesses a potential to become the basis of active nanoplasmonic 
technologies. It will be possible to build ultrafast processors of information with spasers replacing 
MOSFETs. The spasers can also be used in nanosensing, nanoimaging, and nanolithography, and many 
other fields. Since initial introduction of spaser, Stockman was followed by many research groups from all 
over the world in developing the spaser both theoretically and experimentally. Recently there has been 
experimental confirmation and observation of spaser jointly by three groups published in Nature. An 
extensive wave of publications on the spaser and related nanolasers has followed. The spaser will 
potentially have a revolutionary effect on nanoplasmonics and generally on nanotechnologies. Also, reports 
and comments on the spaser and nanolasers have been published in Nature, Optics Express, et al. citing 
spaser as an original idea. 
In 2004, Mark Stockman published two seminal results introducing adiabatic concentration of 
optical energy on nanoscale in plasmonic tapers and efficient nanolenses of nanoparticle aggregates. Both 
these works enjoyed wide experimental and theoretical following, accumulating hundreds references.  
He is continuing to work very actively. In 2007, he pioneered attosecond nanoplasmonics and 
attosecond nanoplasmonic-field microscopy [in collaboration with a team from Max Plank Institute for 
Quantum Optics (MPQ, Garching, Germany) and Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU, Munich, 
Germany)]. Among recent novel results are plasmonic renormalization of Coulomb interactions (2008), 
time-reversal coherent control on the nanoscale (2008), nanoconcentration of terahertz radiation (2008), 
Giant Plasmon-Induced Drag Effect Rectification (SPIDER) (2009), spaser as a bistable (logical) 
nanoamplifier (2010), and coherent control of third harmonic generation in photonic-plasmonic systems [in 
collaboration with University of Stuttgart, Germany (2010)].  
In 2010 he with his collaborators introduced a novel concept of adiabatic metallization of 
dielectrics in strong fields. In 2011, this concept was developed by him and collaborators to predict the 
dynamic ultrafast metallization of dielectrics. This development of the ultrafast/ultrastrong-field 
condensed-matter optical physics is promising to become a foundation of the new solid state technology of 
information processing that is three orders of magnitude faster than the existing technologies. In 2012, he 
predicted optical field effect in dielectrics where a strong optical field excites electrical currents with a ~1 
fs rise and decay times. This effect was discovered experimentally at MPQ/LMU and published in Nature,

2013, and Nature Photonics, 2014. Another breakthrough was the discovery of efficient generation of hot 
electrons in adiabatic plasmonic compression and its application to chemical nano-vision, published in 
2013 in Nature Nanotechnology. Theory of generation of high harmonics in solids by strong optical fields 
was recently developed (Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014). Recently a multitude of electronic, optical, and plasmonic 
phenomena in graphene and other novel two-dimensional materials in superstrong and ultrafast optical 
fields was predicted and published, 2014-2015.

5. Research 
Theoretical Nanoplasmonics and Nanooptics  
The study includes theory of nanoplasmonics, electronic, optical (especially, nonlinear 
optical and ultrafast optical) properties of nanostructured and nanoscale systems. The 
study invokes advanced analytical methods and large-scale computer modeling.  
This research is supported by grants from the US Department of Energy, US National 
Science Foundation, US-Israel Binational Science Foundation. The total of MIS’s 
extramural funding is in millions of the USD (see GRANTS AND CONTRACTS Section 
for details). MIS’s research group includes Postdoctoral Associates and graduate 
students.  
5.1. Major Results  
• Prediction [81] and invention [38] of Surface Plasmon Amplification by Stimulated 
Emission of Radiation (SPASER). Spaser is similar to laser, but does not emit light. 
Instead, it generates local optical fields of high intensity and temporal coherence. 
Spaser will provide unprecedented capabilities for sensing, probing, manipulation, 
and modification of nano-objects. The SPASER is both the nanoscopic quantum 
generator and quantum amplifier of localized optical fields on the nanoscale. As such 
the SPASER is the “missing” active element of nanoplasmonics. It can amplify 
similar to a common MOS transistor, but is ~1000 times faster. The SPASER has 
recently been observed experimentally and is currently a subject of active research 
efforts of many groups worldwide. 
• Theory 
of 
ultrafast 
phenomena 
in 
solids 
in 
superintense 
laser 
fields 
[4,8,9,11,11,14,18,19]. This predicts semi-metallization effect of crystalline 
dielectrics (such as quartz and sapphire) and wide-band semiconductors. These are 
reversible attosecond-timescale phenomena in strong laser fields. 
• Prediction of Metallization of Dielectric Nanofilms by Strong Fields in adiabatic [32] 
and ultrafast [20] processes.  
• Theory for investigations of bulk dielectrics in strong and ultrafast optical fields: 
field-effect currents [4] and attosecond control of electronic properties [19]. Theory 
of high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids by superintense ultrashort optical pulses 
[2]. 
• Introduction of an effect of Adiabatic Energy Nanoconcentration of Optical Energy 
[66]: high-efficiency transfer of energy from the far zone to near-zone in tapered 
nanoplasmonic waveguides. This effect is highly promising for nanooptics and 
nanotechnology, in particular, for ultramicroscopy and nanomodification. It has been 
confirmed in numerous experiments and set a foundation of new spectroscopic and 
nanoscopic techniques. 
• Introduction of Efficient Nanolens [75] of nanospheres and prediction of a giant 
SERS from it as a substrate. This prediction has been confirmed experimentally.

• Introduction and study of the surface plasmon localization (bright and dark modes) 
[85]; introduction of the nanoplasmonic hot spots [104, 106, 108]. 
• Prediction of Surface Plasmon Induced Drag Effect (SPIDER) [37], which is 
generation of very intense terahertz nanoscale fields in nanowire plasmonic 
waveguides. 
• Introduction of attosecond nanoplasmonics [51]. The proposed attosecond plasmonic 
field microscope allows one directly and non-invasively to measure nanometer-
femtosecond spatio-temporal dynamics of local plasmonic fields in metal 
nanostructures. 
• Prediction [83], theory, and numerical simulation [71] of ultrafast nanoscale energy 
concentration by means of coherent control. This idea provides unique possibilities 
for controlling energy of ultrafast optical excitation of nanosystems on nanometer-
femtosecond spatio-temporal scale. There has recently been the direct experimental 
observations of the coherent control on the nanoscale.  
• Prediction, theory, and numerical simulation of enhanced optical nonlinearities and 
surface-enhanced Raman scattering by fractal clusters and nanocomposites [121, 122, 
128, 132-143]. Many of these predictions have been experimentally confirmed. These 
effects are due to giant fluctuations and enhancement of local fields in nanosystems 
predicted in Ref. [108]. 
5.2. Other Significant Recent Results  
• From the fundamental principle of causality, it is rigorously shown that the negative 
refraction in a uniform and isotropic medium is impossible without significant optical 
losses in the region of the negative refraction [54]. 
• Proposal of the full spatio-temporal coherent control on the nanoscale [52] in plasmon 
polaritonic systems. This allows one to dynamically focus the optical energy in 
nanoscopic spatial region and femtosecond tine intervals simultaneously. In systems 
with localized surface plasmons, a possibility is shown to localize optical excitation 
energy at a given nanoscale site at a required moment of time with femtosecond 
accuracy using the principles of the time-reversal [48]. 
• Theory of the ultimate resolution of the “Perfect Lens” in the near field as determined 
by the spatial dispersion and Landau damping in the electron liquid  [20]. 
• Explanation, theory, and numerical simulation of high-power femtosecond laser 
damage of dielectrics as “Forest Fires” [69]. 
• Prediction and numerical simulation of giant random enhancement of femtosecond 
and attosecond local fields in disordered media (clusters, composites and rough 
surfaces) under ultrafast excitation (“The Ninth Wave” effect) [91].  
• Microscopic theory of radiative and radiationless decay of a quantum dot at a metal 
surface is developed based on random phase approximation for electron gas in metal 
[69]. Giant enhancement of relaxation is predicted. (Collaboration with Los Alamos 
National Laboratory.) 
• Theory and interpretation of experimental results on phase-sensitive near-field 
scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) of metal nanoparticles is developed [69, 78]. 
(Collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory.) 
• Theory, numerical simulation, and interpretation of experimental data on enhanced 
second harmonic generation (SHG) on nanostructured gold surfaces is developed 
[69]. It is shown that for such systems SHG is highly depolarized and dephased,

providing a perspective nanosource of high-intensity illumination on the nanoscale. 
(Collaboration with École Normale Supérieure de Cachan, Paris, France.) 
• Microscopic many-body theory of a 2d electron gas with Coulomb interaction in 
semiconductor quantum structures is developed. The theory is based on Kadanoff-
Baym-Keldysh field-theoretical technique and uses self-consistent random-phase 
approximation (SCRPA, also called the GW approximation) [82, 86, 89]. 
• Microscopic theory of the light-induced (LID) effect based on non-equilibrium 
quantum field theory (Kadanoff-Baym-Keldysh technique) [94]. New properties of 
the LID effect are found that are due to energy dependence of electron scattering. 
• Dipolar spectral theory of linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 
nanocomposites has been developed [92]. These composites are predicted to possess 
greatly enhanced optical nonlinearities.  
• Chaotic behavior of quantum currents in a magnetic field has been shown numerically 
[95]. These currents bear important information on long-range spatial correlation in 
quantum-chaotic states. 
• Predictions, theory, and computer simulation of inhomogeneous localization and 
chaos of elementary excitations (surface plasmons) in nanostructured systems [98, 99, 
102, 104]. A remarkable property of this chaos is the existence of long-range spatial 
correlations.
