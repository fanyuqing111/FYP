Bio
My research is in the areas of multimedia content analysis and computer vision. I lead the BigVid Lab, conducting research on all aspects of extracting high-
level information from big video data, such as video event recognition, object/scene recognition and large-scale visual search. 
I participate regularly in international benchmark competitions. At the annual U.S. NIST TREC video retrieval evaluation (TRECVID), I have designed a few best-
performing systems (among many submissions worldwide) in 2008 video concept detection task and 2010 multimedia event detection task. I am also one of 
the organizers of the THUMOS Challenge on Large Scale Action Recognition. 
My publications and citations on Google Scholar can be found here.
[06/2016] NEW! Our work on image search with hash codes received the 2016 IEEE Trans. on Multimedia Prize Paper Award Honorable Mention.
[02/2016] Due to many requests, researchers interested in getting the videos of the CCV dataset can fill up this form and send to me for a link.
[02/2015] We have released FCVID, one of the largest public Web video datasets with manual annotations (91,223 videos, 239 categories).
[11/2014] Our paper received best poster award at ACM Multimedia 2014.
[08/2014] The website of ACM ICMR 2015 (June 23-26, Shanghai, China) is online.
[08/2014] We have released VCDB, the largest public dataset with manually annotated real partial video copies. 
[08/2014] The workshop of the 2nd THUMOS Action Recognition Challenge will be held in conjunction with ECCV 2014. 
[01/2014] The violent scenes detection dataset used in MediaEval 2013 is available online, jointly provided by Technicolor, Fudan, and UIT Vietnam.
