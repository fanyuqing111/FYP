Biography                 
Koichi Shinoda received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan in 1987 and 1989, 
respectively, both in physics, and the D. Eng. Degree in computer science from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, in 
2001. In 1989, he joined NEC Corporation, Japan, where he was involved in research on automatic speech recognition. From 
1997 to 1998, he was a Visiting Scholar with Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ. From June 2001 to September 
2001, he was a Principal Researcher with Multimedia Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation. From October 2001 to March 
2002, he was an Associate Professor with the University of Tokyo, Japan. He is currently a Professor with the Tokyo Institute 
of Technology. His research interests include speech recognition, video information retrieval, statistical pattern recognition, 
and human interfaces. He received the Awaya Prize from the Acoustic Society of Japan in 1997 and the Excellent Paper 
Award from the IEICE in 1998. He was Publicity Chair in INTERSPEECH2010, Video Program Co-Chair in ACM 
Multimedia 2012. Dr. Shinoda is a senior member of IEEE, IEICE. He is a member of ACM, IPSJ, JSAI, and ASJ. He was a 
subject editor of Speech Communication from 2013 to 2015. He is currently an associate editor of Computer Speech and 
Language, Elsevier.
