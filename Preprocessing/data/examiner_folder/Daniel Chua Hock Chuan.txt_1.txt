Research Interests 
1. Diamond-like carbon, soft carbon materials for coatings and MEMS  
2. Carbon nanospheres, carbon black materials (0D) 
3. Carbon nanotubes and core-shell nanotube materials (1D) 
4. 2D Graphene, MoS2, WS2 materials (2D) 
5. and various composites and derivatives of these materials. 
 
Our work includes synthesis of these materials using different physical and chemical deposition techniques 
available in our laboratories e.g. PLD, FCVA, CVD etc. After extensive characterisation of the materials and physical 
properties, we design and apply these materials directly into PEM fuel cells, Li-air batteries, Supercapacitors, 
electron emitters and others. We also work on thin and thick films, such as diamond-like carbon, metal carbides 
and other materials, for chemical and corrosion-resistant protective coatings. Thick films are also applied as 
complementary materials in MEMS structures. One industrial area of expertise is in failure analysis and materials 
characterisation where surface analytical techniques, such as XPS, AES and SIMS, were used to analyze 
microelectronics and media devices.  
 
Notable work* includes:- 
1. Low temperature growth of graphene using PLD. 
2. Conventional epitaxy growth of MoS2 on Si substrates. 
3. Graphene coated nano-size spindt tips for electron emitters 
4. Hybrid graphene/carbon nanotubes and MoS2/carbon nanotubes in PEM fuel cells 
5. Hydrogen evolution studies in 2D materials
