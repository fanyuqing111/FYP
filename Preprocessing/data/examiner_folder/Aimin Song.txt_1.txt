Biography
Professor Aimin Song received PhD degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1995. 
After three years of fellowships at University of Glasgow and University of Munich by the 
Royal Society and Alexander von Humboldt foundation, he worked at the Nanometre 
Consortium, Lund University as a Guest Lecturer before moving to Manchester as a Lecturer 
in 2002. He became Professor of Nanoelectronics in 2006. His research is focused on novel 
nanoelectronic devices and printable thin-film electronics.  His work has led to awards

nanoelectronics, microwave , wearable electronics, terahertz, power electronics
QC Physics  - condensed matter physics, Nanostructures
including "Researcher of the Year" Distinguished Achievement Medal of the University of 
Manchester and a Royal Society Brian Mercer Feasibility Award. The potential of practical 
applications of the nanodevices for printable electronics and energy harvesting have 
motivated a number of commercialization activities including 15 patents/patent applications 
and a spin-out company. The novel device concepts that he developed have been further 
studied in two EU Framework projects. His research has been published in Nature 
Communications, Physical Review Letters, NanoLetters, Nanoscale, etc, and has also 
generated a number of media reports. 
His PhD students have also received a number of very prestigious awards for their successful 
research, including a Rolls Royce Prize (£1,000) at the UK Parliament, Distinguished 
Achievement Medal for "Postgraduate Student of the Year" of the University of Manchester, 
"Best Output (Publication) Award" of the University of Manchester, Outstanding Non-
Governmentally Financed Ph.D. Students Abroad Award ($5,000) for Chinese students (twice), 
a number of Best Conference Paper Awards, etc.
