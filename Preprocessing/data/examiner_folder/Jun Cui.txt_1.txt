Information 
Dr. Cui holds joint positions at Ames Laboratory and Materials Science  Department at the 
Iowa Stated University. His group manages extensive materials synthesis, sample preparation 
and characterization capability for the department and for the Ames Laboratory, and has 
access to state-of-art national characterization facilities at Ames Laboratory, Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, and at NIST. His frontier 
research on energy-related science and engineering and wide industry collaboration provide 
students extensive exposure to the state-of-art research philosophy and methodology, which 
is crucial for students’ career development.

Interest Areas 
Dr. Cui’s research focuses on ferroic materials and their applications in clean energy 
applications. Current research projects include 1) high fatigue life elastocaloric materials for 
cooling and refrigeration; 2) low critical field rare-earth-free magnetocaloric materials for 
room temperature and cryogenic refrigeration; 3) high silicon content electrical steel for 
transformer and motors; 4) rare-earth-free permanent magnetic materials for motors; 5) 
additive manufacturing of rare-earth magnetic materials for efficient use of critical materials; 
6) high throughput alloy development for light weight structural materials and for harsh 
environmental applications.
