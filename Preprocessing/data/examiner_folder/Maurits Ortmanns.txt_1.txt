Prof. Dr.-Ing. Maurits Ortmanns
Maurits Ortmanns received the Dipl.-Ing. in electrical
engineering from the Saarland University, Saarbruecken,
Germany, in 1999 and the Dr.-Ing.degree from the Albert-
Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany, in 2004, both with
highest honors.
In 1997 and 1998, he was with the Research Center
Karlsruhe, Germany, and with EXAR, Inc., Fremont, CA, as
an engineering intern working in the field of Microsensors. In
1999, he joined the Institute of Microelectronics at the
Saarland University, where he was working as are search
assistant. In 2001, he moved to the Institute of Microsystem

Technology, 
Albert-Ludwigs-University, 
where 
he 
was
working toward the Ph.D. degree in the field of continuous-
time sigma-delta modulator design until 2004.
From 2004 - 2005, he has been with sci-worx GmbH,
Hannover, Germany, where he was working in the field of
mixed-signal and analog circuits for biomedical implants, low-
voltage, low-power applications, and high-speed circuits. In
the beginning of 2006, Dr. Ortmanns joined the HSG-IMIT,
Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany, and was additionally a
guest lecturer at the University of Freiburg, Germany. In May
2006, he was appointed a Juniorprofessorship for Integrated
Interface 
Circuits 
at 
the 
Institute 
for 
Microsystems
Engineering in Freiburg.
Since May 2008, Prof. Ortmanns is full professor at at the
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at
the University of Ulm, where he heads the Institute of
Microelectronics.
Prof. Ortmanns received the VDI and the VDE award for his
Master studies in electrical engineering from the Saarland
University in 1999, the ITG Publication Award 2015, and the
Best Student Paper Awards at MWSCAS 2009 and at
SampTA 2011. He also received the faculty's teaching award
2012 and 2015.
He served as program committee member of the European
Solid State Circuits Conference (ESSCirC), the Design
Automation and Test Conference (DATE) and the European
Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD), 
Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions of Circuits and
Systems I, Guest Editor of the IEEE Journal Solid State
Circuits, and is currently Associate Editor of the IEEE
Transactions of Circuits and Systems II. Prof. Ortmanns is a
Technical Program Committee member of the IEEE
International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) since
2012,  an Executive Committee member of ISSCC since 2013
and European TPC Chair of ISSCC 2015. He holds a dozen
patents, is author of the book “Continuous-Time Sigma-Delta
A/D Conversion”, and published several other book chapters
