I am an associate professor in the Computer and Information Sciences Department and a 
JP Morgan Chase Faculty Fellow in the Institute for Financial Services Analytics. I also 
have a joint appointment in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. My 
research interests are in high-performance computing, machine learning, predictive 
analytics, and application of these technologies to hard problems. 
I was one of the first researchers to work on applying machine learning to improve 
compilers. This field of research has rapidly grown to include hundreds of authors from 
many major universities and technology companies. Compilers typically contain many 
heuristics to solve hard problems approximately and efficiently. Finding heuristics that 
perform well on a broad range of applications and processors is one of the most complex 
tasks faced by compiler writers. My research involves using machine learning techniques 
to automatically construct compiler optimization heuristics. I have shown that this 
technique can completely eliminate the human from heuristic design. My research on 
applying machine learning to compiler optimizations received the NSF CAREER award.
