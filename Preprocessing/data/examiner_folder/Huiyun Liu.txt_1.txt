Huiyun Liu received the Ph.D. in Semiconductor Science from the Institute of Semiconductor, Chinese 
Academy of Sciences. After receiving his PhD, he joined the EPSRC National Centre for III-V Technologies 
at University of Sheffield in August 2001. He was responsible for the development of Molecular Beam 
Epitaxy growth of semiconductor materials for the UK academic and industrial research community. In 
2007, he was awarded Royal Society University Research Fellow and started his academic career in the 
Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at UCL as a Senior Lecturer.
He has co-authored over 100 peer-reviewed journal papers in the area of semiconductor materials and 
devices. His general interest concentrates on the nanometre-scale engineering of low-dimensional 
semiconductor structures (such as quantum dots, quantum wires, and quantum wells) by using molecular 
beam epitaxy and the development of novel optoelectronic devices including lasers, detectors, and 
modulators by developing novel device process techniques.
