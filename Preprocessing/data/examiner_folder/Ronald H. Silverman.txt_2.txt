Ronald H. Silverman, PhD
Professor of Ophthalmic Science (in Ophthalmology)
Dr. Silverman has been involved in ultrasound research in
ophthalmology for 30 years. His research includes development of
high-resolution imaging systems, studies of ultrasound safety and
bioeffects, high-intensity ultrasound, blood-flow imaging,
photoacoustics, and tissue characterization by use of signal-
processing. He applies these techniques for studies of ocular
disease in animal models and for clinical examinations.
Dr. Silverman is currently Principle Investigator on an NIH-
sponsored project whose goal is development of a novel ultrasonic
imaging technique, ultrafast plane-wave imaging, which enables
acquisition of up to 10,000 images per second. Computer-analysis
of the data allows visualization and measurement of blood-flow
throughout the eye and orbit. This technique is being applied to
glaucoma, vascular malformations and occlusions. Collaborators on
this project include Raksha Urs, PhD, Jeffrey Ketterling, PhD
(Riverside Research) and Alfred Yu, PhD (University of Waterloo).
He is also collaborating with Riverside Research scientists Jonathan
Mamou, PhD and Daniel Rohrbach, PhD on a novel method called
scanning acoustic microscopy for imaging and characterizing tissue
sections. This method utilizes ultrasound probes with frequencies of
250-500 MHz, 10x higher than that used for clinical imaging of the
eye, to produce image detail comparable to light microscopy, but
more importantly, information about the physical properties of the
tissue, including elasticity and density. Dr. Silverman is using this
system to assess the cornea, sclera and optic nerve in keratoconus,
myopia and glaucoma.
Dr. Silverman has numerous patents and was a co-founder of
Ultralink, LLC, which, under license from Cornell University,
developed the Artemis ultrasound system for imaging and biometric
analysis of the cornea and anterior segment. Ultralink has since
been acquired by Arcscan, Inc., which is further developing the
technology.

Dr. Silverman is active in several professional organizations. He
served on the ARVO Program Committee, Anatomy & Pathology
Section, from 2008-2011 and is currently on the program committee
of the ARVO Imaging in the Eye Conference. He is also on the
program committee and a co-organizer of the International
Conference on Ultrasonic Biomedical Microscanning. He is a Fellow
of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology
(FARVO), the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (FAIUM),
the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineers
(FAIMBE) and is a Senior Member of the IEEE.
Aside from presenting and moderating at numerous meetings, Dr.
Silverman has also often acted as an organizer for special sections.
He is frequently asked to review articles in journals specializing in
ophthalmology, ultrasound and optics. In addition, he serves as a
grant-reviewer for the NIH.
Dr. Silverman has mentored and trained numerous students,
fellows, and residents that have worked in his laboratory over the
years and considers this an important aspect of his work.
Since 2012, Dr. Silverman has been Director of the Basic Science
Course in Ophthalmology (BSCO) which has been offered by
Columbia University for over 75 years. With the able assistance of
Stephen Tsang, MD, PhD (co-director), Harriet Lloyd, MS, Kenia del
los Santos and Suzanne Daly (co-managers), the BSCO teaches
students, primarily ophthalmology residents, from all over the world.
The four-week course consists of approximately 120 hours of
lectures on clinical ophthalmology and vision research plus 25 hours
of workshops and wet-labs, with lecturers from Columbia University
as well as national and international luminaries in their fields.

Research Interests
Imaging and characterization of ocular tissues with ultrasound alone or in combination with optics
The use of high-resolution ultrasound to map the layers of the cornea to detect changes indicative of early keratoconus
The use of ultrasound to remotely palpate tissues such as the cornea or retina to non-invasively probe their elastic
properties, using both ultrasound and optical coherence tomography to measure ultrasound-induced tissue
displacements
The use of lasers in combination with ultrasound in a process called photoacoustic imaging to visualize light-absorbing
tissue structures, such as the microvasculature
Ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery and advanced probe design and signal processing for improved sensitivity and
resolution in ultrasound images
