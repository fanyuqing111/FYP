Jurgen Michel is a Senior Research Scientist in 
the Microphotonics Center and a Senior Lecturer 
in the Department of Materials Science and 
Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. He leads research projects in 
silicon-based photonic materials and devices as 
well as advanced solar cell designs. His main 
focus is currently on on-chip WDM devices, Ge-
based high performance detectors and 
modulators, and Ge-based lasers with the goal 
to implement active photonics devices in CMOS 
based chips. 
Prior to joining MIT in 1991 he was Postdoctoral 
Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell 
Laboratories, studying defect reactions and 
defect properties in semiconductor materials. He 
was educated in Germany and earned his 
diploma in Physics at the University of Cologne 
and his doctorate and habilitation in Applied 
Physics at the University of Paderborn. He has 
co-authored more than 200 refereed scientific 
papers, 4 book chapters, 19 awarded patents, 
and more than 20 pending patents.
