Biography
Dr. Huang received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical 
Engineering, National Taiwan University in 1986, and the M. S. and Ph. D. 
degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of 
Maryland, College Park in 1990 and 1993, respectively.
He joined the Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics (GIPO) 
and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University in 
2006. He served as the Chairman/Director of GIPO from August 2007 to 
July 2010. Prior to joining National Taiwan University, he served as 
Chairman/Director of the Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National 
Sun Yat-Sen University from April 2003 to Jan. 2006. His expertise is on 
fiber based photonics and tomography technologies.Dr. Huang is a senior 
member of the IEEE and a member of the Optical Society of America and 
the Photonics Society of Chinese-Americans. He served as the Chairman of 
IEEE Photonics Society Taipei Chapter, 2005-2006, and was a Topical 
Editor of Optics Letters from 2005-2011. He is presently a steering board 
member, European Master of Science in Photonics (EMSP). Dr. Huang was 
the recipient of Ministry of Education Outstanding University/Industry 
Cooperation Award, 1997. He has jointly awarded various competitions 
with his students on Chimei Innovation Excellence Award (2010) and 
Optical Communications Elite Award (2005).
