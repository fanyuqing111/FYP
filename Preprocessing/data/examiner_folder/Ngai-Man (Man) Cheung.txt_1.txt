Biography
Biography
I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of
Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA, in 2008. My Ph.D. research
focused on image and video coding, and the work was supported in part
by NASA-JPL.
From 2009-2011, I was a postdoctoral researcher with the Image, Video
and Multimedia Systems group at Stanford University, Stanford, CA.
I have also held research positions with Texas Instruments Research Center
Japan, Nokia Research Center, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, HP Labs
Japan, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),
and Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL). My industrial work has
resulted in 6 U.S. patents granted with several pending.
My research interest is to develop advanced algorithms to enable e�cient
processing of multimedia data. I am also interested in exploring
collaborative and interdisciplinary research that involves applying signal
processing or multicore technology to address problems in other areas.
