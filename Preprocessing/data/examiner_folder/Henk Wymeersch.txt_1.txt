Biography 
 Henk Wymeersch is a Professor in Communication Systems with the Department of Electrical 
Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. He is also affiliated with the FORCE 
research center on fiber-optic communication, and was the PI of COOPNET, an ERC project on 
cooperative networks. Prior to joining Chalmers, he was a Postdoctoral Associate during 2006-2009 
with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT). Henk Wymeersch obtained the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering/Applied

sciences in 2005 from Ghent University, Belgium. For his thesis, he received the 2006 Alcatel Bell 
Scientific Award. He received a fellowship from the Belgian American Educational Foundation in 2005-
2006. He is a member of the IEEE, and served as Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on 
Communications (2016-present), IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (2013-present), for 
IEEE Communication Letters (2009-2013) and the Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications 
Technologies (ETT) (2011-2016). He served as Guest Editor for IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in 
Communications (JSAC, special issue on Location-aware Radios and Networks), EURASIP Journal on 
Wireless Communications and Networking (special issue on Localization in Mobile Wireless and Sensor 
Networks), and for EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing (special Issue on Signal 
Processing Techniques for Anywhere, anytime positioning). In 2015, he served as General Chair of the 
International Conference on Localization and GNSS. He has co-authored over 100 contributions in 
journals and international conferences, and is the author of Iterative Receiver Design (Cambridge 
University Press, August 2007). In 2009, he was part of a team that won the L3 Communications Prize 
at the 2009 Soldier Design Competition, for the practical demonstration of cooperative ultra-wide 
bandwidth (UWB) localization. Other awards include a best paper award at Globecom 2009 and a  
NEWCOM++ best paper award in 2010. His research interests include algorithm design for wireless 
transmission, statistical inference and iterative processing. (Personal website)
