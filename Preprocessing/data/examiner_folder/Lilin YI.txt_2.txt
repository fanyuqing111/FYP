Biography
    Lilin Yi received his B.S. (2002) and M.S. (2005) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). He achieved Ph.D. degree from
EcoleNationaleSupérieure des Télécommunications (ENST), France and SJTU, China on Mar. and Jun. 2008 respectively as a
joint-educated PhD student. After graduation, he worked at Oclaro (after Avanex and Bookham merger) R&D center as a product
development manager, presided Alcatel-Lucent 100G novel optical amplifier and Avanex next generation optical amplification
platform projects. Since 2010, he has joined the State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Network,
SJTU. His research interests are novel optical access networks and photonic information processing. He has published more than
60 papers in peer-reviewed technical journals and conferences. His authored papers have been cited by SCI more than 280 times.
His papers have been positively citedby Books "Slow light: Science and Applications" (CRC press), "Fiber-Optic Communication
Systems, Fourth Edition" (WILEY press), "Advances in Optical Amplifiers" (INTEC press) and multiple review papers including
Nature Photonics. He has achieved "The excellent master thesis" in shanghai on 2007 and "The excellent PhD thesis" awards in
China on 2010. Currently he is IEEE/OSA member and the active reviewer for IEEE Photonics Technology Letters,  IEEE/OSA
Journal of Lightwave Technology, Optics Letters and Optics Express.
