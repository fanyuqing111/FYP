Chengbo MOU 
 
Professor in Optics, Shanghai University, China 
mouc1@shu.edu.cn 
 
Prof. Mou has authored and co-authored more than 100 papers in international recognised 
journals and conferences in specialty fibers, fiber sensing devices, and fiber lasers. From 2016, 
he has been appointed as the “Young 1000 Talent Plan Professor” at the Key Laboratory of 
Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks (SFOAN), Shanghai Institute for Advanced 
Communications and Data Science, Joint International Research Laboratory of Specialty Fiber 
Optics and Advanced Communication, at Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.  
 
His research interests are advanced fibre devices and their applications in sensors and lasers, 
ultrafast fibre lasers, nanophotonics, vector soliton dynamics etc. My research group works on 
the fabrication and characterisation of nanomaterial based nonlinear photonic devices. We then 
use these devices to achieve ultrashort pulse generation within the fibre laser cavity. Various 
interesting pulse dynamics would then be found within such lasers by studying light-matter 
interaction and cavity dynamics. Closely working with colleagues at Aston University in United 
Kingdom, we are currently working on the polarisation dynamics of ultrashort vector soliton pulses. 
Other key collaborators are from China, Japan, UK, and Russia etc.
