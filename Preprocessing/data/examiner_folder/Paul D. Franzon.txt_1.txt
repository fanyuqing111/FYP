B. INSTRUCTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
1. NSF-funded CISE Infrastructure effort, “Experimental High Performance 
  
Computing and Communications Systems''.   (Total: $1,338,283  including  $503,046  in   
matching.)  Approximately  $283,000 of   this funding went towards outfitting  the ECE 
Design Center. 
 
2. CAD Tools.  Modern design is done with sosphisticated  Computer – Aided Design 
Tools, not with  pencil and  paper.  I  have spent  considerable  effort bringing such  tools 
into the Unity environment, gaining the `corporate  knowledge' about how to use these 
tools effectively and obtaining additional computers for use with these tools. Students tell 
me  that knowledge of these tools is highly regarded  by  potential employers. In fact one 
student stated  that `Dr. Franzon teaches courses that gets jobs'.  In addition , in 1999, we  
won the  Cadence University Alliance  Best  Web  site Awards.  Through my funded 
research efforts and Corporate Donations  introduced  the following Computer Aided 
Design Tools into  the curricula: 
• Cadence Design Systems.  A complete suite of over 4 GB of executables     
that  facilitate chip, board and system design, with a retail value of over 
$100,000,000.  Cadence donates these tools because of the widespread 
recognition of our contributions to CAD.  (i.e. It waives the $5,000 fee.) 
• Synopsys.  The industry leading chip (ASIC) synthesis tool,with a retail 
value of  over $7,000,000.

• In 2008, NCSU won the “Babbage Award” from Sun and Synopsys, in 
recognition of our contributions towards lab infrastructure.  The award comes 
in the form of $15,000 of computers. 
• Mentor.  We integrate some mentor graphics tools with the other tools above.  
The tools have a retail value of over $5,000,000.  Mentor donates these tools 
because of the widespread recognition of our contributions to CAD.   
•  Mentor donates $30,000 annually to the University to assist in CAD 
infrastructure development. 
As well as obtaining these tools, my group has spent considerable effort making these   tools 
useful to us by writing integration scripts and generating `know-how'.  Much of this `know-
how' has been published on the Web and in our own lockers.  Most  of this learning was 
conducted driven by research needs and serves as an excellent   example of the integration 
of research and teaching.  This work is ongoing.   For example, over 2000 organizations 
world-wide, use our “Physical Design Kit”.. 
 
3. ECE 745.  ASIC Verification.  I introduced this course in 2007, though it was taught by 
Meeta Yadav. 
 
 4. ECE 342, Design of Complex Digital System,  Fall 1996: 
• Completely redesigned and updated course to reflect modern design practices, 
and  use of modern Hardware Description Languages and Design Tools. 
• Completed a new laboratory course ECE 342L for use with this course. 
 
 5.   ECE 520 ASIC Design (formerly `Fundamentals of Logic Systems'), Spring 1997: 
• Based on my teaching of ECE592B in Spring 1995, this course has been              
completely updated to reflect modern design practices, modern tools, and 
emphasize an understanding of algorithms used in modern tools.    (`ASIC' stands 
for   `Application Specific Integrated Circuit'. For example the chips  in a satellite 
dish receiver are ASICs.  ASIC engineering is the fastest growing area of ECE 
today.) 
• Once the course action forms are approved, this course will be taught concurr-
ently with ECE 420 ASIC Design. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.   ECE 544, Design of Electronic Packaging and Interconnects, Spring 1995. New c- 
 
ourse emphasizing `transmission line effects' in electronic packages and  how   to   design 
`deep sub-micron interconnect'.  I receive  tremendous  demand  from  ind- 
 ustry 
for graduates from this course. 
 
7.  ECE 691/693A, Computer Engineering Graduate Seminar  
• Created new seminar course  (with Dr. Tom Conte) for computer engineering 
students. 
• Recruited and scheduled weekly speakers. 
 
8. ECE CAD Lab. $75,000.  Provost Office, 1995.

With higher core clock speeds, and the trend to multi-core, the demands on chip I/O are 
increasing rapidly. The key question is how to increase both the density and speed of chip 
I/O without increasing packaging costs. At high speeds, crosstalk issues typically dictate 
inter-pair spacings of four times the wire width in PCBs, and rich use of power and ground 
shields in connectors. In this research, we will investigate coding and circuit techniques 
that enable a group of signals to travel down a wire bundle, and potentially connectors and 
cable assemblies, without crosstalk

Time-Temperature History Within a Product During Processing, Transportation, and 
Storage,” CAPPS, $60,000, 11/01/06 – 12/31/07.  and 5/1/06-4/30/10 Co-PI. 
 
Improving food quality, enhancing food safety, and aiding process filing with the FDA are 
three important areas of interest to the food industry. Accurate determination of the time-
temperature history at the critical point in a system (slowest heating point) is necessary to 
accomplish this. We would like to make use of the RFID technology to capture and 
transmit internal temperatures of food particulates while they are being pumped through 
the heating, holding, and cooling sections of a continuous flow food processing system.

IV. EXTENSION AND ENGATEMENT WITH CONSTITUENCIES 
OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY 
 
A. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
 
• NCSU Education and Research Design Kit.  This is a CAD tool (software) kit that 
enables researchers to design silicon chips using the MOSIS brokered foundries, 
and the popular Cadence And Mentor Design Tools.  Originally introduced in 
1994, we maintain this kit actively.  Right now, there are over 2,000 active users, 
dominated by Universities, but also used by Industry..  I started and lead this 
activity.  It has won several prizes from Cadence and the Cadence Users Group.  
With Rhett Davis, it recently expanded in a 45 nm PDK.  Several tool tutorial were 
also recently added. More information can be found at www.ece.ncsu.edu/cadence 
 
• NCSU Spice2Ibis Converter.  This is a freeware software utility that allows the 
automatic macromodeling of chip input/output in the EIA IBIS standard.  We have 
supported this converter since 1997.  Version 3 was written last year.  There are 
over 3,000 active users, mainly Industry.  Together Michael Steer and I started and 
maintain this activity.  More information can be found at www.ece.ncsu.edu/s2ibis
