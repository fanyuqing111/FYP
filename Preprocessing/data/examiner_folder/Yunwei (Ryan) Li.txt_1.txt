Biography
I received the Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree 
from Tianjin University, China, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from 
the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang 
Technological University, Singapore, in 2006. 
In 2005, I was a Visiting Scholar with the Institute of Energy 
Technology, Aalborg University, Denmark, where I worked on the 
medium voltage dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) system. From 
2006 to 2007, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the 
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson 
University, Canada, working on the high power converter and 
electric drives. In 2007, I also worked at Rockwell Automation 
Canada as a R&D Engineer and was responsible for the 
development of power factor compensation strategies for current 
source fed motor drives. Since 2007, I have been with the 
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of 
Alberta, Canada.
