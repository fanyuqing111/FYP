RESEARCH GRANTS: 
 
During the period from 1982 to 1989, Dr. Rashid received external funding from NSERC (National 
Science and Engineering Council of Canada) and FCAR (Fonds Pour La Formation De Chercheus 
Et La'Aide a La Recherche, Quebec Govt., Canada), while he  had been with Concordia University, 
and supported graduate students and research.   
 
With my academic administrative responsibilities including accreditation, developing new programs 
and also for the lack of graduate programs, I was focusing mostly (since 1989) on teaching and 
administrative aspects rather than funded research.
