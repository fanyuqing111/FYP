Happy to be a PI with Centre 
for Autonomous Systems, 
which just receives $7.1 
millon funding as one of the 
three proposals funded by 
Alberta Government. 
Congrats to Moein for his 
CVPR 2019 paper, "Moving 
Object Detection under 
Discontinuous Change in 
Illumination Using Tensor 
Low-Rank and Invariant 
Sparse Decomposition" 
Three papers accepted by 
ICRA 2019. Congratulations 
to Shing-Yan, Ali, Zhuang and 
Xinghong (from GDUT), 
Weinan, Dr. He (and their co-
authors). 
Three papers accepted by 
IROS 2018. Congratulations 
to Weinan, Sepideh, Moein, 
Menna and Sara (and their 
co-authors). 
About
I am a Professor in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. I received my BSc 
degree from Northeastern University (US) and my PhD from Purdue University. After a year of post-
doctoral training at the University of Pennsylvania, I joined the U of A in 1988. 
My research interests include robotics, computer vision, and image processing. I have worked in a number 
of areas in robotics and, for the past 10+ years, my focus has been on visual robot navigation. In 2003-17, 
with support from the federal and provinncial goverments, I held an NSERC Industrial Research Chair to 
conduct research in computer vision and image processing that addresses the practical challenges facing 
Alberta's mining industry. As a member of the NSERC Strategic Network on Field Robotics (NCFRN) I work 
closely with Canadian academic colleagues and industrial partners on mobile robotics research. Within the 
international robotics community, my activities include a variety of roles in ICRA and IROS communities, as 
well as other IEEE RAS sponsored conferences.
