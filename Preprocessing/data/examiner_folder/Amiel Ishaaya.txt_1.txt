Synopsis of research: 
The following summarizes the main research conducted at Ben-Gurion University since the lab was 
active (2009): 
1. Single solid core fiber laser configurations based on PCFs  
In this research topic we focused on designing, building, and investigating high power PCF 
lasers based on a rod-type, very large core, active (Yb) double clad fiber. We investigated 
various resonator configurations and managed to demonstrate in CW TEM00 operation more 
than 72W with 79% slope efficiency, and in high repetition Q-switched pulsed operation 38W 
average power with 76% slope efficiency and 192kW peak power. To the best of our knowledge 
these results represent a record with regard to pulsed fiber lasers. During the design we came 
up with a new off-axis pumping method of PCF double clad fibers with significant advantages 
over standard on-axis pumping. We also submitted a patent application on this method. 
2. Phase locking and coherent combining of multiple fiber lasers 
Here we investigated several sub topics. In the first we focused on phase locking of a linear 
array of 8 low power fiber lasers via diffraction coupling (Talbot effect). With the experimental 
setup that was built we demonstrated anti-phase locked operation and characterized it. We 
measured an exponential phase decorrelation between distant lasers in the array, and discussed 
its fundamental limitation on scalability of this and similar local coupling methods. When the 
output coupler was positioned half a Talbot distance from the laser channels we showed that 
phase clustering occurs in the array whereby the array separates into two different phase locked 
clusters. Further theoretical analysis and experimental measurements showed that these clusters 
result from an incoherent superposition of the in-phase and out-of-phase super-modes of the 
array. By inserting selective loss in the resonator we managed to demonstrate operation in a 
nearly single pure in-phase super-mode. Finally, with this experimental setup we studied and 
demonstrated experimentally different system states: full coherent lasing, polarization-locked 
lasing, frequency locked lasing without phase-locking, and independent incoherent lasing. 
In the second subtopic we investigated in detail phase locking and coherent addition of two 
fiber laser channels connected with an interferometric coupler. Specifically, we investigated the 
possibility to spectrally narrow the operation of two coherently combined fiber lasers. To the 
best of our knowledge, we show for the first time that by placing a narrowband spectrally

selective element in only one of the channels, the spectral content is efficiently imposed on the 
other channel, and both channels operate with a narrow bandwidth. 
In the third subtopic we are currently investigating phase locking and coherent addition of two 
Q-switched pulsed high peak power PCF laser channels. We achieved already 0.7 MW of peak 
power with 10ns pulses by intracavity coherent addition of two laser channels. This is a new 
record in fiber oscillators and shows great potential for further scaling of peak power. 
3.  
Raman amplification in gas filled hollow core photonic bandgap fibers 
Here we built a dedicated vacuum/pressure system that allowed us to evacuate air out of the 
fibers, and fill the hollow core bandgap fiber with a suitable gas. With CF4 and SF6 gases we 
did not observe any Raman shift of the Ti:sapphire ultrashort (fs) laser pulses after propagation 
within the fiber, but we did observe self phase modulation and characterized it compared to 
focusing ultrashort pulses in high pressure free space gas cells. Recently, we investigated 
Raman conversion of ns pulses in a CF4 filled PBGF. We obtained a record of more than 35% 
conversion efficiency in a 35cm-long, weakly pressurized, fiber at a peak power of only 2.6kW. 
This is still work in progress. 
4. Wavelength conversion in solid core PCFs 
Here we investigated degenerate four wave mixing with ns pulses in fused silica photonic 
crystal fibers. Phase matching curves were calculated, followed by experiments with a ns pulsed 
Nd:YAG pump laser and relatively short fiber lengths that showed more than an octave 
spanning conversion to idler and signal wavelengths at 3.105 μm and 0.642 μm, respectively. 
These results represent a new stretch towards the limit of the silica transmission window in the 
mid-IR. 
5. Design of new active and passive fibers 
We proposed two novel fiber desings. In the first we proposed and investigated theoretically a 
new concept for single-large-mode amplification in double-clad active fibers. The concept is 
based on exploiting a very small fiber core, guiding only a single transverse mode that has large 
overlap with a doped active cladding. We show that the guided mode can have very large area 
with good modal discrimination. This simple structured fiber can be used in an 'all-fiber' 
configuration. We further investigate the sensitivity to small refractive index changes of the 
doped area and to bending of the fiber. Our proposed fiber concept could lead to fibers with 
very large mode area with advantages over current commercial fibers. 
The second design focuses on hollow core photonic bandgap fibers that have two highly 
separated bandgaps. Using the Plane Wave Method we have recently found two rather simple 
PBGF designs that support two highly separated transmission bandgaps that are suitable for 
THG. These designs are based on silica without any doping, and the smallest features in both 
designs are more than 30 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported so far, 
and is an excellent starting point for achieving THG in gas filled fibers. 
6. Waveguides on chip 
Here we managed to fabricate and characterize optical quality Chalcogenide waveguides. This 
will enable future experiments for efficient on-chip wavelength conversion to the mid-IR. 
Furthermore, we managed to improve the coupling into Silicon waveguides by using a novel 
multi-taper technique. This is still work in progress. 
7. Fs inscription of fiber Bragg gratings with phase masks 
This is work in progress. We already inscribed high quality permanent FBGs in silica fibers 
with both 800 and 266 nm fs pulses. Furthermore we managed to locally erase FBGs, “immune” 
fibers agains FBG writing, inscribe phase-shifted gratings, inscribe two different gratings on 
the same fiber section, obtain Bragg center wavelength tunability by adding spherical phases to 
the inscribing beam, and obtained preliminary results showing reflections from transient fiber 
Bragg gratings.
