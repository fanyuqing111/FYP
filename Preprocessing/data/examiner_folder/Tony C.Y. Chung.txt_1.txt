activities and applied research in power systems engineering development in the province of Saskatchewan. He is
a Fellow of IEEE and IET. He is also an IEEE PES Distinguished Lecturer and the Member­at­Large (Global
Outreach) of IEEE PES Governing Board.
Dr Chung received the B.Eng. degree (with First Class Honors) and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China, in 1995 and 1999, respectively. He has worked for
Powertech Labs, Inc., Surrey, BC, Canada; the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; and The Hong Kong
Polytechnic University, China. Dr Chung’s research interests include smart grid, renewable energy, power system
stability/control, planning and operation, applications of advanced optimization methods, power markets and electric
vehicle charging. His research work has not only generated 3 US patents, 2 book chapters and over 100 SCI journal
papers, but has also resulted in successful transference of three new commercial software packages developed for
power system analysis. Software package “Small Signal Analysis Tool (SSAT)” developed by him is now being used
