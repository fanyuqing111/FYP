Russel Jacob (Jake) Baker received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical 
engineering from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in 1986 and 1988. He 
received 
the 
Ph.D. 
degree 
in 
electrical 
engineering 
from 
the University of Nevada, Reno in 1993.  
 
EMPLOMENT 
1981 to 1987: he served in the United States Marine Corps Reserves (Fox Company, 
2nd Battalion, 23rd Marines, 4th Marine Division).  
1985 to 1993: he worked for E. G. & G. Energy Measurements and the Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory designing nuclear diagnostic instrumentation for 
underground nuclear weapons tests at the Nevada test site. During this time he 
designed, and oversaw the fabrication and manufacture of, over 30 electronic and 
electro-optic 
instruments 
including 
high-speed 
cable 
and 
fiber-optic 
receiver/transmitters, PLLs, frame- and bit-syncs, data converters, streak-camera 
sweep circuits, Pockels cell drivers, micro-channel plate gating circuits, and analog 
oscilloscope electronics. In  
1991-1992: he was an adjunct faculty member in the department of electrical 
engineering at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).  
1993 to 2000: he served on the faculty in the department of electrical engineering at 
the University of Idaho (UI).  
2000-2011: he joined a new electrical and computer engineering program at Boise 
State University (BSU) where he served as department chair from 2004 to 2007. 
At BSU he helped establish graduate programs in electrical and computer 
engineering including, in 2006, the university’s second PhD degree.  
2012-present: he re-joined the faculty at UNLV where he is currently a Professor of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering. During his tenure at the UI, BSU, and UNLV 
he has been the major professor to more than 75 graduate students.  In addition to

Over the last 32 years his research and development interests have been, or currently 
are, focused on analog and digital integrated circuit design and fabrication, design of 
diagnostic electrical and electro-optic instrumentation for scientific research, 
integrated electrical/biological circuits and systems, array (memory, imagers, and 
displays) fabrication and design, CAD tool development and online tutorials, low-
power interconnect and packaging techniques, design of communication/interface
