i
The Scopus Author Identifier assigns a unique number to groups of documents written by the same author via an 
algorithm that matches authorship based on a certain criteria. If a document cannot be confidently matched with an 
author identifier, it is grouped separately. In this case, you may see more than one entry for the same author.
