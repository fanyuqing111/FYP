Overview
Dr Lan Wang is an Associate Professor in the at RMIT University.
Research fields
Our research fields focus on topological condensed matter systems, spintronics, and magnetic materials. We grow single crystals, thin films and
nanostructures. Based on these materials, we fabricate devices for electron and spin transport measurements. We also collaborate with other
research groups to investigate the optical properties of these novel materials and devices. Our aims are to understand the fundamental physics of
these novel materials and devices and to fabricate the next generation prototype spintronic devices.
Techniques for our research
Growth and characterization of materials
i. Ultra high vacuum (UHV) systems and thin film deposition 
ii. Single crystal growth 
iii. Nanostructure growth
Device fabrication using E-beam and photo lithography
Characterization of electric and magnetic properties of materials
i. Standard magnetic measurements 
ii. Measurements and analysis of the quantum oscillations of single crystalline systems in high magnetic field and low temperature 
iii. Point contact spectroscopy (Point contact Andreev reflection)
