Hi Tariq, 
  
Congratulations, I have managed to get your thesis approved from PCC.  
Since the thesis is containing Rolls‐Royce IP which are not submitted/ published yet, we have to take due diligence on 
compliance to process. Please seek advice from Amit/Rejeki/Tarshan on the process do’s and don’ts that need to be 
followed and make sure we would not risk the Rolls‐Royce IP.   
  
You have got the following comment from Mark. “Approved - Good Luck a good PhD with strong supporting papers and 
patents“  
  
I will you good luck for a speedy examination process. 
Thank you 
Best regards 
Chandana
