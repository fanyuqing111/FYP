Research:
Dr. Smedley is interested in power electronics, alternative energy power generation, and motion 
control.
Dr. Smedley's research involves the modeling, control, and topologies of switching converters and 
inverters with applications such as class-D power amplifiers, power factor corrections, active power 
filters, grid-connected inverters, soft-switching, and motion control.
Her research involves power and signal processing with the use of energy-efficient electronics 
circuits. She has developed one-cycle controlled high-fidelity class-D power amplifiers, which has 
led to a span-off company in Orange County. She is currently developing a new generation of power 
factor corrected rectifiers and grid-connected inverters for alternative energy power generation. The 
softswitching methods evolved from her lab are widely used in industry.
Her research can be applied to computer power supplies, communication equipment, wireless 
communications, class-D amplifiers for homes and theatres, aviation electronics, space electronics, 
motor drive, alternative energy converters, and space power.
Dr. Smedley is director of the Power Electronics Lab at UCI.
