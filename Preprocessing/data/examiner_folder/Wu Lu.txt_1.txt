4284A LCR meter, 8510C network analyzer, N8975A noise receiver, Focus Microwave 
Automatic Load-Pull Tuners, DIVA D-265, etc. The system can perform DC, CV (20 Hz to 1 
MHz), pulsed-IV (down to 200 ns), small signal (45 MHz to 50 GHz), noise ( up to 18 GHz), 
large signal load-pull (1.8 to 18 GHz) measurements from room temperature up to 300C. See a lab 
picture.
