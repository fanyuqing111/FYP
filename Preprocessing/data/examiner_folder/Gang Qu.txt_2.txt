*ISI mainly indexes journal articles and does not include conference papers. In the area of 
computer engineering, papers in top conferences are more competitive and cited more often.  
 
I have given 43 invited talks and professional presentations. 
 
I have received grants and contracts as PI/Co-PI for a total of $2.92 millions, out of which my share 
is $1.32 million ($1.63 millions and $1.19 millions, respectively, were awarded after my tenure 
decision was made).
