Short Vita 
Elias B. Kosmatopoulos received the Diploma, M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Technical 
University of Crete, Greece, in 1990, 1992, and 1995, respectively. Dr. Kosmatopoulos is a 
Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Democritus University 
of Thrace, Greece (www.ee.duth.gr) . He has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of 
Production Engineering and Management, Technical University of Crete (TUC), Greece and Deputy 
Director of the Dynamic Systems and Simulation Laboratory at TUC. Prior to joining TUC, he was 
Research Assoc./Assist. Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, 
University of Southern California (USC) and a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical 
& Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, B.C., Canada. 
Dr. Kosmatopoulos’ research interests are in the areas of nonlinear and adaptive control, robotics, 
energy-efficient buildings and intelligent transportation systems. He is the author of some 40 journal 
papers and over 100 book chapters and conference publications. Among his contributions, the most 
significant are the following: 
• 
Analysis of the approximation and stability properties of Recurrent High Order Neural 
Networks (RHONNS). 
• 
Globally convergent learning laws for Recurrent High Order Neural Networks (RHONNS). 
• 
Adaptive controllers for unknown nonlinear systems.

• 
An Adaptive Fine-Tuning (AFT) tool for 
o rapid fully-automated fine tuning of highly-nonlinear and complex Large-Scale Control 
Systems (LSCSs) 
o Cognitive Adaptive-based Optimization (CAO) of multi-robot applications. 
• 
A Convex Control Design (ConvCD) tool that provides arbitrarily-close-to-the-optimal control 
design for highly-nonlinear and complex LSCSs and Multi-Robot Applications. 
• 
AGILE, re-configurable and self-adaptable LSCSs. 
• 
Real-life large-scale control implementations in various areas such as segmented telescopes, 
traffic control systems, energy efficient buildings and swarms of flying or underwater 
robotic vehicles. 
Dr. Kosmatopoulos has been involved in various applied research projects virtual reality, intelligent 
manufacturing systems, fault detection in TV cable plants, telecommunications, control of space 
telescopes, control of air vehicles and hypersonic vehicles, mitigation of earthquake effects to civil 
structures, intelligent highway systems, intelligent transportation systems, traffic control, agile ports, 
energy positive buildings and robotic swarms. While in the U.S. he was involved as the Principal 
Investigator, Co-Principal Investigator or Technical Consultant in many research projects funded by 
NASA, Department of Transportation and Air Force or the private sector. Currently he is involved in 
research projects (funded by the EU, the Greek Secretariat of Research & Development and the 
private sector) involving Energy Positive Buildings, Robotic Swarms and Intelligent Transportation 
Systems .
