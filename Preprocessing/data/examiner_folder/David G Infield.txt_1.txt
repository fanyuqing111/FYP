SUMMARY OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO JOINING STRATHCLDE 
 
My years with BSRIA were concerned with applied research in the built environment.  My background in 
Mathematics and Physics proved useful but this was an intense period of learning Engineering, primarily heat 
transfer and control.  I made some useful contributions working alongside Oscar Faber, the building services 
engineers, to the design of integrated solar air heating systems including a then advanced variable air volume 
control system, now widely used in such systems worldwide. 
 
Moving to RAL required to work on wind energy in its early days gave me the opportunity to learn about the 
engineering of small power systems, from both the mechanical and electrical point of view.  I became an expert in 
wind diesel systems, working closely with Hawker Siddeley Power Plant, and later Dale Electric Ltd and Laings, to 
develop prototype systems.  Wind diesel technology proved hard to commercialise, mainly because of the lack of 
financial resources available to those who most needed the power.  Nevertheless, the integrated designs to which 
I contributed remain of commercial interest overseas, particularly in the USA and now there is a growing interest 
in such mini-grids for power supply in rural Africa. 
 
My work at RAL developed in the direction of wind turbine technology with an emphasis on unsteady 
aerodynamics and aeroelastics and I became part of the international effort to improve wind turbine modelling that 
now underpins current turbine design.  With partners at Heriot-Watt I pioneered the application of Particle Image 
Velocimetry (PIV) to aerodynamics and rotor aerodynamics in particular.  We were the first to publish measured 
flows through rotors showing blade bound circulation and also wake effects.  Similar techniques were 
subsequently applied by DLR in Germany and NASA in the USA.   
 
I went on to apply the understanding of wind turbine dynamics to the development of condition monitoring for wind 
turbines.  This ground-breaking work has led on to an active programme of research into condition monitoring 
specifically for wind turbines.  It is now acknowledged that advanced diagnostic systems are essential for reliable 
offshore wind turbine operation and research undertaken in close cooperation with manufacturers is now 
underway at Loughborough.      
 
I joined Loughborough University in 1993 to establish a new centre.  This continues to be known as CREST 
(Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Research) and its aims are to: 
 
 
Contribute to the development and implementation of renewable energy through high quality research and 
demonstration 
 
 
Work with research institutions, industry and related organisations at home and abroad to promote 
renewable energy 
 
 
Provide training and education in both theoretical and practical aspects of renewable energy systems 
technology

CREST grew significantly in size and reputation under my direction over my 13 years at Loughborough.  When I 
left in September 2007 the centre had 20 staff of which 4 were permanent academic posts, 22 PhD students, was 
teaching around 100 MSc students each year (some by Distance Learning), and had a research portfolio of over 
£3 million (not all of this directly mine).  My personal research activities at Loughborough were focused on wind 
and photovoltaic (PV) energy generation, with a particular emphasis on integration into electricity supply systems.  
In the last years there I expanded this to include the general issue of generation capacity embedded in the 
electricity distribution system, whether renewable or conventional, and the building integration of PV with its 
associated thermal modelling challenges.  During my time at Loughborough University I personally attracted 
research contracts from EPSRC, DTI, CEC, and industry worth a total of over £3 million.  These included a 
significant number of small to medium sized projects, and some lucrative commercially supported research 
projects.  Throughout my time at Loughborough I developed strong links with industry and almost all my research 
was carried out in close collaboration with commercial partners.  Industry contributed substantially to the building 
at Loughborough, under my direction, of the UK‟s largest PV and most sophisticated PV research and 
development laboratory, including state of the art deposition and materials processing equipment alongside the a 
comprehensive suite of analysis equipment including ellipseometry, SEM, etc. 
 
The MSc in Renewable Energy Systems that I developed and managed is widely regarded by the renewables 
sector as the international market leader.  Since 1994 over 400 students were graduated and many now hold 
senior posts in organisations across the UK and overseas.  Contacts in the wind energy sector indicate that the 
CREST graduates were considered first when new posts are being created.  In addition, I ran an annual one 
week wind energy course for the industry.  This course was a response to the growing demand for more 
advanced wind engineering knowledge and skills by the sector.  I have also run bespoke wind training events for 
specific wind developers. 
 
Alongside my University research I regularly undertook consultancy work for industry: clients include E.ON, British 
Gas, Solar Century, Marlec Engineering, and FKI.   
 
We also completed some interesting work on small-scale wind/PV powered sea-water desalination systems.  In 
contrast to previous approaches we demonstrated that a system with battery storage could be designed without 
degradation in system efficiency.  A pre-production prototype was developed and this was short-listed for the 
ALTRAN prize in 2003.  There continues to be commercial interest in our design. 
 
There has been increasing interest in Building Integrated Wind and I have worked with a number of commercial 
companies on prototype development. In addition MSc students have carried out projects of direct relevance. In 
2005 I chaired a session at the BRE conference on Small Wind and gave a paper at the 2006 BRE event on 
Building Integrated Wind. 
 
In my time at Loughborough I attracted a total of over 30 PhD students, most of these funded by EPSRC or other 
external funding including a number directly funded by industry.  To date most of these have successfully 
completed their PhD theses under my direct supervision. 
 
I negotiated CREST‟s membership of EUREC, an exclusive grouping of the leading European renewable energy 
research centres, and have recently been appointed to the management board.  This reflects the scale and 
quality of the research activity that I established at Loughborough.  Together with EUREC I put together the EU‟s 
first European Masters degree in Renewable Energy, this ran for the first time in 2002/3 and is now attracting 
many well qualified applicants; the programme involves a number of Europe‟s leading Universities including Ecole 
Des Mines de Paris, and NTUA.   
 
A particular success in those years was establishing the Faraday Partnership for Integration of New and 
Renewable Energy in Buildings (INREB) together with a limited number of leading UK research institutes.  This 
Partnership had wide industrial and commercial support and has since evolved into a DTI Knowledge Transfer 
Network led by BRE.

MY RESEARCH AT STRATHCLYDE 
 
I joined Strathclyde University, one of the EU‟s leading centres for electric power generation, in September 2007 
and have now established productive research links across many Departments of the University and built up a 
substantial research portfolio.  There have been a number of early success including a number of grants related 
to the DSM potential of electric vehicles; a platform grant from EPSRC for renewable energy integration, and 
together with Professor Bill Leithead, the Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) in Wind Energy Systems. More recently 
there have been substantial EPSRC grants covering the transition of the UK electricity system to sustainable 
generation and a UK-India grant on PV systems performance, TSB funded research on electric vehicle charging 
strategies, and ETI finding for wind turbine condition monitoring.  I have played an important role in building 
strategic research collaborations with the major electricity suppliers in Scotland under the framework of the 
Technology Innovation Centre and as part of this have built up a strong research activity on wind turbine asset 
management and also further work on condition monitoring including support from EDF, E.ON and Vattenfall. 
 
In wind energy, my personal research is focussed on: 
 
 
Wind turbine power curve testing; 
 
Control and system integration of wind turbines with focus on frequency support services; 
 
Wind resource prediction and assessment including spatial-temporal wind field modelling; 
 
Condition monitoring for wind turbines, in particular using SCADA data; 
 
Wind farm performance modelling and output prediction; 
 
Demand side management for wind, including energy storage technologies.  
 
I have assisted a number of companies in the design and testing of small turbines.  I was invited to chair 
discussion on building integrated wind at a national events organised by BRE in 2005 and presented an invited 
paper to the follow on event in 2006.  I sit on TUV-NEL‟s wind turbine testing accreditation oversight group. Most 
of my research these days is however concerned with large scale turbines for offshore.   
 
I am the Manager of the Wind Energy Systems Doctoral Training Centre at Strathclyde.   This was the outcome of 
a successful highly competitive bid made to EPSRC in 2007.  Over 30 CDT students are now in place PhD with 
an increasing number directly funded by Industry (EDF and Gamesa in particular).  Almost all the PhD topics 
come from industry.  There is a particular emphasis on working with industry to scale up the technology from 
established turbines in the range 2 to 5 MW, up toward the sizes required for future offshore operations, ie 6 to 10 
MW, and of installing operating this technology offshore. This is very challenging engineering and requires 
applied research of the highest level.  There is also a strong research theme of wind integration into power 
systems, undertaken with SSE, Scottish Power, NG and others. It is pleasing that the growing reputation of the 
Doctoral Training Centre is increasingly drawing the industry to us to provide engineering solutions to their 
problems.   I work directly with both SSE and SP to support their Technology Innovation Centre participation.  
Indeed most of my research is undertaken in close collaboration with industry.  I am the HiDEF Supergen 
consortium PI; a project concerned with highly distributed energy futures and supported a large number of UK 
companies including SSE, SP, Rolls Royce etc. 
 
I play my part in the support of national institutions and the UK Government.  I advice DECC on research 
priorities; I also assisted Government select committees in the area of renewable energy research policy and a 
few years ago took the lead in assembling evidence on renewables for the UK DTI Energy Review, and for the 
House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (both in conjunction with UKERC). 
 
I have a strong international presence:  I‟m Editor in Chief of the IET journal Renewable Power Generation (I was 
founding editor of this journal which is now well established with a high and growing international impact); I 
participate in the EU Wind Platform and the Smart Grids Platform, supporting the CEC in drawing up research 
policy in these two related areas; I have acted as an independent assessor for the CEC and a number of 
overseas agencies and Universities (including SFI in Ireland, the Canadian, US and Cypriot Governments, and 
the University of Stuttgart); I am Visiting Professor at North China Electric Power University and a Chinese

Government funded visiting expert over the next 5 years; for many years I was a guest lecturer at EPFL in 
Lausanne; I represent the UK on relevant international standards committees (see below); and I‟m a DECC 
sponsored Lead Author on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change).   I also lead the Strathclyde 
team supporting Sir Gordon Wu and Hopewell Engineering in Hong Kong with the development of a very large 
HAWT turbine.  A 300kW prototype is presently under test in China.  I also have an established link with the two 
senior Academicians at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and in particular with their Energy Committee. 
 
New Standards are a key to the effective commercial development of technology. I have been an active member 
of the International Electro-technical Committee TC82, concerned with photovoltaics, for many years.  I also 
represent the UK PV sector on the associated CENELEC and BSI committees. My earlier research on the grid 
connection of PV, particularly on harmonics and islanding underpins key elements of the Standards, including the 
UK document G83.  Other research that I have pioneered with colleagues in the past concerns the real world 
performance of PV systems and in particular the influence of solar spectra.  The results of this work are now 
accepted by the international community and will lead to Standards that underpin more accurate electricity yield 
estimates from PV systems, essential for purchaser confidence in the technology. 
 
My most important present external research relationships and the topics of research emphasis are listed in the 
table below:

challenge of wind integration 
 
UMASS, Massachusetts, USA 
 
A long standing collaboration on wind system modelling with 
Professors Manwell and McGowan 
 
Riso/DTU  
These are the world leaders in wind energy research and as 
would be expected I have a close relationship to a number of 
their leading researchers notably Helge Madsen, Martin 
Hansen and Henrik Bindner.  These links cover my interests in 
wind turbine modelling and grid integration.

Analysis of offshore wind farm data 
 
 
 
My photovoltaics (PV) activity has declined since moving to Strathclyde in order to re-focus my research on wind.  
I was responsible for the management of PV research road mapping for the UK Energy Research Centre, the 
influential national energy centre support by the UK Research Councils.    I have established a PV test system on 
the roof of the James Weir Building at Strathclyde and work closely with the ESRU team at the University.  My 
research here is mainly on improved MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) for PV systems and I participate in 
an EPSRC/India consortium to refine and commercialise the new technology we have developed and 
demonstrated. 
 
 
As is expected of a University based researcher, my work is widely published in the professional literature with 
over a hundred refereed journal papers, and I am regularly requested to give presentations, join committees, write 
review articles and undertake other research related activities such as refereeing journal papers.  International 
research links and presence are important and I have particularly strong research collaborations with Denmark, 
China, Korea, and the USA (as listed in the table above).   I also have good research contacts in Universities and 
industry in Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Spain.
