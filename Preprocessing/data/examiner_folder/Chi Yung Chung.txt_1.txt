Biography 
Dr. C.Y. Chung is a Professor, the NSERC/SaskPower Senior Industrial Research Chair in Smart Grid 
Technologies, and the SaskPower Chair in Power Systems Engineering in Smart Grid Technologies, 
and the SaskPower Chair in Power Systems Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada. He is a prominent leader for 
advancing academic activities and applied research in power systems engineering development in the 
province of Saskatchewan. He is now leading a research team, supported by SaskPower and NSERC 
of Canada, to conduct cutting-edge and long-term smart grid research for SaskPower and address 
critical technical issues associated with smart grid technologies and their applications to real power 
systems. He is a Fellow of IEEE and IET. He is also an IEEE PES Distinguished Lecturer and the 
Member-at-Large (Global Outreach) of IEEE PES Governing Board. 
 
Dr. Chung received the B.Eng degree (with First Class Honors) and the Ph.D. degree in electrical 
engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China, in 1995 and 1999, respectively. His 

-----
research work has not only generated 3 US patents, 2 book chapters, and over 120 international journal 
papers, but has also resulted in successful transference of two new commercial software packages 
developed for power system analysis. Software package "Small Signal Analysis Tool (SSAT)" 
developed by him is now being used by over 80 power companies and nearly 90 universities worldwide. 
 
Dr. Chung was the Member-at-Large (Smart Grid) of IEEE PES Governing Board, the Past Chairman 
of the IEEE Hong Kong Section, IEEE Hong Kong Joint Chapter of PES/IAS/PELS/IES and IET Hong 
Kong PES. He was the General Chair of IEEE EPEC2017 and IEEE PES APPEEC2014, Co-Chair of 
IEEE TENCON2015, IEEE PES APPEEC2013 and IEEE ICHQP2012, Vice-Chairman of IET 
APSCOM 2015 and IET APSCOM 2012, Technical Chairman of IET APSCOM 2009, and Honorary 
Secretary of IEEE DRPT2004 and IEEE IAS 2005 Annual Meeting. 
 
Dr. Chung is currently an Editor of IEEE Transactions of Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on 
Sustainable Energy, and IEEE Power Engineering Letters, and an Associate Editor of IET Generation, 
Transmission & Distribution, CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems, and Journal of Modern 
Power Systems and Clean Energy.
