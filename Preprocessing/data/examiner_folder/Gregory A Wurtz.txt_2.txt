Dr. Gregory Wurtz obtained his Ph.D in Physics in 2000 from the University of 
Technology of Troyes, France. He then held successive post-doctoral positions at 
Argonne National Laboratory (USA), the University of Mulhouse (France), and 
Queen’s University Belfast (UK). He held tenure-track positions at the 
University of North Florida in Jacksonville from 2007 to 2011, and at King’s

WoS, 36 Google Scholar), and holds rights to 7 patents. His research was 
sponsored in excess of $10M since 2000. His current research interests are on the 
interaction of light with nanostructured materials, including plasmonic systems 
and hybrids thereof, in the particular context of ultrafast, coherent, and nonlinear 
optical effects and spectroscopies.
