Domenico Pacifici
Domenico Pacifici
Associate Professor of Engineering, 
Associate Professor of Physics
Overview
Domenico Pacifici is an Associate Professor of 
Engineering and Physics at Brown 
University and Director of the Nanofabrication 
Central Facility (former Microelectronics Core 
Research Facility). He is the recipient of a 
Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award, 
three Brown Research Seed Awards, a 
Dedicated Faculty Award from Brown’s School 
of Engineering and Tau Beta Pi, and a Henry 
Merritt Wriston Fellowship “for his 
contributions to excellence in teaching and for 
the devotion to the intellectual development of 
both graduate and undergraduate students.” 
His research efforts have focused on the opto-
electronic properties of erbium doped silicon 
quantum dots for silicon-based microphotonics 
and fundamental light-matter interactions at 
the nanometer-scale for biosensing and energy 
harvesting applications. He has pioneered the 
field of plasmonic interferometry and received 
grants from the National Science Foundation, 
from the Office of Naval Research, and from the 
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. 
He is currently a Visiting Associate Professor at 
the University of Maryland College Park, in the 
Institute for Research In Electronics & Applied 
Physics (IREAP), and a CNST Visiting Fellow in 
the Nanofabrication Research Group at the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST). As part of his sabbatical leave, he is 
working with Dr. Henri Lezec on photon drag 
detection, negative optical pressure, and the 
development of active materials for 
implementation of novel plasmonic lasers and 
electrically-pumped plasmon sources.

Education:
Domenico Pacifici joined Brown University in 
2009 as an assistant professor in the School of 
Engineering. Professor Pacifici received his 
M.Sc. (2000) and Ph.D. (2004) in Physics, both 
summa cum laude, from the University of 
Catania in Italy, where he studied the optical, 
structural and electrical properties of silicon 
quantum dots and their interaction with rare-
earth ions for a silicon-based Microphotonics. 
In 2004 he received an award from 
STMicroelectronics, a global leader in 
electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, 
for the best PhD thesis performed in 
collaboration with industry. Prior to joining 
Brown, he spent four years as a postdoctoral 
scholar in the Department of Applied Physics at 
the California Institute of Technology.

Professor Pacifici and his research group are 
currently leading research projects involving 
nanostructured materials to manipulate light 
and surface plasmons for integrated optical 
communication, sensing and energy-harvesting 
applications. 
Recently, the Pacifici Group has achieved the 
following results:
(1) plasmonic concentrators for broad-band 
enhanced absorption in ultra-thin film solar 
cells; 
(2) germanium quantum dot photodetectors 
with responsivity and internal quantum 
efficiency rivaling conventional silicon-based 
technologies; 
(3) high-throughput biochemical sensors using 
plasmonic interferometers integrated on-chip 
for detection of extremely low glucose and 
insulin concentrations, typically found in saliva, 
for non-invasive glucose screening; 
(4) plasmonic interferometry to measure the 
refractive index dispersion of dielectric 
materials;
(5) measurement of subwavelength coherence 
length of electromagnetic fields with plasmonic 
interferometers;
(6) modulation of the fluorescence emission 
through nano-apertures  with plasmonic 
interferometry for sensing;
(7) nano-imprinted silicon nanowire solar cells 
with high internal quantum efficiency;
(8) estimate of the optical bandgap in 
amorphous germanium quantum wells.
