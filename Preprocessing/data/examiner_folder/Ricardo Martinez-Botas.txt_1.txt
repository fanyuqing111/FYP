Professional experience 
Ricardo has an MEng (Hons) Degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Imperial College London. He 
obtained a DPhil in the Rolls Royce University Technology Center at the University of Oxford University 
in 1993 with a thesis entitled Annular Cascade Aerodynamics and Heat Transfer. 
He has developed the area of unsteady flow aerodynamics of small turbines, with particular application to 
the turbocharger industry. The contributions to this area centre on the application of unsteady fluid 
mechanics, instrumentation development and computational methods. The work has attracted support not 
only from Government agencies but also from industry. His group has become a recognised centre of 
turbocharger turbine aerodynamics, and more particularly in the application experimental methods and 
one dimensional calculation procedures. 
In 2010 and 2009 he was awarded the best paper award by the Turbomachinery Committee of ASME and 
in 2011 has been given the Dugald Clerk Prize by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (UK) for 
contributions to internal combustion engines.  He is a Visiting Professor in the University Teknologi of 
Malaysia. He has published extensively in journals and peer reviewed conferences. He is Associate Editor 
of the Journal of Turbomachinery (ASME) and the Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science (IMechE). 
He is currently the Theme Leader for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles of the Energy Futures Lab at Imperial 
College. 
Qualification:  
Experienced in modeling and design of energy systems, which is similar to the topic of the main contents 
of this thesis, modeling and design of thermoelectric generator
