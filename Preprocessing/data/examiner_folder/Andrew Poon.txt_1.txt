 Faculty
 
Andrew W. Poon received his B.A. degree (with Hons.) in Physics
from The University of Chicago, Illinois, in 1995, M.Phil. and Ph.D.
degrees in Physics from Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut in
1998 and 2001, respectively. In 2001, he joined the Department of
Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology, as an Assistant Professor. He is currently a
Professor and Director of the Nanosystem Fabrication Facility (NFF).
He has authored or coauthored 180 papers in journals and international
conferences, co-authored three book chapters, co-edited one book and
awarded two patents. He has served as the chair of The IEEE Photonics
Society, Hong Kong Chapter (2008–2009). During his second-term
tenure, the Hong Kong Chapter was awarded the Society “Chapter of
the Year” Award 2009. He has served on and chaired various technical
program committees of international conferences, and as a guest editor
of the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics. He is
currently a Senior Editor and an Associate Editor of the IEEE Photonics
Technology Letters. His current research interest includes silicon
photonics, heterogeneous integrated III-V-on-silicon photonics, optical
microresonators, on-chip optical interconnects, integrated nonlinear and
quantum photonics, optical manipulation of particles/cells and
biosensing.
