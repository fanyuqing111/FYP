Dimosthenis Peftitsis was born in Kavala, Greece, in 1985. He received the
Diploma degree (Hons.) in electrical and computer engineering from the
Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi, Greece, in 2008 and the Ph.D.
degree from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in
2013. In 2008, he was with the ABB Corporate Research, Västerås, Sweden,
for six months, where he was involved in the diploma thesis. From 2013 to
2014, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher involved in the research on SiC
converters at the Department of Electrical Energy Conversion, KTH Royal
Institute of Technology. From 2014-2016, he was working as a Postdoctoral
Fellow at the Lab for High Power Electronics Systems, ETH Zurich, where he
was involved in dc-breakers for multiterminal HVDC systems. In May 2016, he
joined the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim,
Norway, as an Associate Professor of power electronics at the Department of
Electrical Power Engineering. His current research interests are in the area of 
WBG (e.g. SiC, GaN) power converters design, gate and base driver designs
for WBG devices, as well as dc-breaker concepts for MV and HVDC systems.
Prof. Peftitsis is Senior Member of IEEE and a member of the EPE
International Scienti�c Committee.
