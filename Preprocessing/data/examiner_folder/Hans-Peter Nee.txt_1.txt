Curriculum vitae: Hans-Peter Nee 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hans-Peter Nee was born in 1963 in Västerås, Sweden. He received the M.Sc., Licentiate, and 
Ph.D degrees in electrical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, 
Sweden, in 1987, 1992, and 1996, respectively. In 1999 he was appointed Professor of Power 
Electronics in the Department of Electrical Engineering. His interests are power electronic 
converters, semiconductor components, and control aspects of utility applications, like 
FACTS, HVDC, wind power converter systems, and variable-speed drives. At present, the 
two main focus areas are multilevel converters for high-power applications and high-
efficiency SiC power electronics for various applications. Up to now he has supervised and 
examined 20 finalized doctor’s projects. 
 
Prof. Nee was awarded the Energy Prize by the Swedish State Power Board in 1991, the 
ICEM'94 (Paris) Verbal Prize in 1994, the Torsten Lindström Electric Power Scholarship in 
1996, and the Elforsk Scholarship in 1997. He has served in the board of the IEEE Sweden 
Section for many years and was the chairman of the board during 2002 and 2003. He is also a 
member of EPE and serves in the Executive Council and in the International Steering 
Committee. He is also an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, and 
was the Guest Editor-in-chief for the special issue on “wide bandgap power devices and their 
applications” in published in the same journal in May 2014.
