April 2003  Present (12 years 5 months)
Ravi Silva is the Director of the Advanced Technology Institute (ATI) and heads the Nano-
Electronics Centre (NEC), which is an interdisciplinary research activity. The NEC has over 50 
research staff. He joined Surrey in 1995. 
Ravi studied at the Eng. Dept. at Cambridge Univ. for his undergraduate and postgraduate work. 
His research has resulted in over 500 presentations at international conferences, and over 500 
journal papers. He is the inventor of 25 patents.
Ravi is the external examiner for the University of Cambridge Engineering Tripos. He is an external 
examiner for Universities in the Uk and also abroad.
In 2003 the largest EPSRC Portfolio award for £6.68M was made to Prof. Silva and his team on 
Integrated Electronics, which was followed in 2004 by a SRIF award for £4M to set up a Nano-
Electronics Centre for multidisciplinary research. In 2005, the Nano-Electronics Centre was a finalist 
in the Emerging Technologies category of the IEE 2005 Awards for Innovation in Engineering.
Prof. Silva was on the advisory board of Imprimatur Ltd and the National Nanotechnology Initiative 
(NNI) of Sri Lanka. He spent the year 2008 acting as an Advisor to the Honourable Minister of 
Science and Technology in Sri Lanka, and was intrumental in setting up the Sri Lanka Institute of 
NanoTechnology (SLINTec) and the Nano-Science Park NANCO (private) Ltd. He acts as an 
advisor to both these activities and sits on the director board. Prof. Silva was also a member of the

A critical look at organic photovoltaic fabrication methodology: Defining 
performance enhancement parameters relative to active area
Elsevier
July 2014
In this paper we report the analysis of large organic photovoltaic (OPV) data sets (0.64 cm2) by 
revealing the most promising fabrication methodology where we proved that masking OPV can 
artificially boost power conversion efficiency through fill factor and current density and also with 
minimal mask siz
e (50%  active area) this effect can be eliminated. This paper shows a reliable 
method to characterise OPV devices without artificially boosting the power conversion efficiency.

High luminance organic light-emitting diodes with efficient multi-walled 
carbon nanotube injectors
Carbon
September 2012
We report on high luminance organic light-emitting diodes using acid functionaliz
ed multi-walled 
carbon nanotube (o-MWCNTs) as efficient hole injector electrodes, using a simple, solution 
processable device structure. At only 10 V, the luminance approaches 50,000 cd/
m2 with an 
external q
uantum efficiency over 2%  and a current efficiency greater than 21 cd/
A. The investigation 
of hole-only devices shows that the mechanism for hole injection changes from injection limited to 
bulk limited because of the higher effective work function of the anode modified by the o-MWCNTs. 
We expect the enhancement of the local electric field, brought about by both the dielectric 
inhomogeneities within the o-MWCNT containing anode and the high aspect ratio carbon 
nanotubes, improves hole injection from the anode to the organic active layer at much lower applied 
voltage.

Solution-Processable Graphene Oxide as an Efficient Hole Injection Layer 
for High Luminance Organic Light-Emitting Diodes
Journal of Materials Chemistry C
March 2013
The application of solution-processable graphene oxide (GO) as a hole injection layer in organic 
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is demonstrated. High luminance of over 53 000 cd m 2 is obtained 
at only 10 V. The results will unlock a route to apply GO in flexible OLEDs and other electrode 
applications.

viability of GO devices, with comparable PCEs, suitable as high chemical and thermal stability

Solution processed core shell nano-structures of metal oxide-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are 
used as improved electron transport layers (ETL), leading to an enhancement in photocurrent 
charge transport in PCDTBT:

Decoration of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes with Protected Iron 
Nanoparticles
Carbon
November 2014
A method to simultaneously synthesiz
e carbon-encapsulated magnetic iron nanoparticles (Fe-NPs) 
and attach these particles to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) is presented. Thermal 
decomposition of cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer [
(C5H5)2Fe2(CO)4]
, over a range of 
temperatures from 250�
 C to 1200�
 C, results in the formation of Fe-NPs attached to MWCNT. At 
the same time, a protective carbon shell is produced and surrounds the Fe-NPs, covalently 
attaching the particles to the MWCNT and leading to resistance to acid dissolution. The carbon 
coating varies in degree of graphitisation, with higher synthesis temperatures leading to a higher 
degree of graphitisation. The growth model of the nanoparticles and subseq
uent mechanism of 
MWCNT attachment is discussed. Adsorption potential of the hybrid material towards organic dyes 
(Rhodamine B) has been displayed, an indication of potential uses as material for water treatment. 
The material has also been electrospun in to aligned nanocomposite fibres to produce a soft 
magnetic composite (SMC) with future applications in sensors and fast switching solenoids.

Highly Aligned Arrays of Super Resilient Carbon Nanotubes by Steam 
Purification
Carbon
Steam treatment has been applied to our prefabricated highly aligned areas of electrospun carbon 
nanotube composite nano-fibres, leading to controlled and targeted removal of polymeric and 
amorphous carbon materials, resulting in areas of highly aligned, highly crystalline, pure nanotubes. 
Raman analysis suggests that some carbon nanotubes are more resistant to steam assisted 
oxidation, meaning that specific carbon nanotube diameters are preferentially oxidised. The 
remaining carbon nanotubes have displayed a significant improvement in both q
uality, with respect 
to defect density, and in crystallinity, resulting in an increased resistance to oxidation. These steam 
treated super resilient carbon nanotubes are shown to withstand temperatures of above 900 �
C 
under ambient conditions. Applying this purification method to electrospun nano-fibres leads the 
way for the next generation of composite materials which can be used in high temperature extreme 
environments

Printable electron field emitters could lead to cheap and scalable large area electron sources. This 
paper presents work on electron field emission from water-based multiwall carbon nanotube 
(MWCNT) dispersions, and introduces new results on emission from different substrates. We 
summariz
e work in which MWCNTs are deposited onto paper, glass, and plastic substrates, and 
show that the field emission characteristics can be tailored by controlling the underlying morphology 
as well as by post-laser irradiation. We also show that engineering the work function of MWCNTs 
can significantly enhance field emission, and that resonant tunneling effects may be induced by 
suitable surface functionaliz
ation.
