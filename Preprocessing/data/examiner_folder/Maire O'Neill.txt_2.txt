Teaching Experience  
(Since Jan 2013 my teaching duties have been limited due to my EPSRC Engineering Leadership Research 
Fellowship, maternity leave (Jan – Jul 2010; Dec 2012 – Jul 2013; Aug 2016 - Mar 2017) and my role as Director of 
RISE). 
 
In 2013/14 I took on the role of Course Director of a new MSc in Cyber Security. This involved extensive 
market research to identify best practice, unique selling points, and the skills requirements of cyber security 
companies. I introduced internship opportunities into the new programme structure as part of the dissertation 
study (commended by the programme’s external examiner).  
 
In 2015/16 I played an integral role in the development of a revised MSc in Applied Cyber Security, with 
modules delivered in block mode to target industry demand for professional training. The new MSc also 
offers applicants unique access to a full range of applied skills development and networking opportunities, 
including entrepreneurship and innovation training. 
 
I co-ordinated the successful application for provisional GCHQ certification of the MSc in Cyber Security 
in 2016 and assisted with the full certification application, which was successful in early 2017. 
 
In 2014/15 I developed a new Masters level module on Applied Cryptography for the MSc programme that 
included practical, hands-on laboratory exercises and a research-informed coursework exercise.  I achieved 
Teaching Evaluation scores of 4.8 and 4.5 out of 5 in 2014/15 and 2015/16 respectively. In 2016/17, I 
updated and improved the module for block-mode delivery to incorporate best-practice for intensive-style 
learning, achieving a Teaching Evaluation score of 4.6. 
 
In 2015, I was awarded $25k funding under Intel's University Program for Curricula design, which I used 
to develop a new lab for the Applied Cryptography module.  
 
In 2017 I adapted the module material for online delivery as part of a pilot scheme with Kainos. I recorded 
and adapted the material for Queens’ online platform. It will be possible to integrate this material into the 
block-mode delivery of the module to offer blended learning in the future. 
 
Successfully applied for three NCSC-sponsored undergraduate 8-week internships (offering students £300 
per week) to be hosted in CSIT, 2018. 
 
Level 2 Circuits & Systems (2004 – 2012) with an average teaching evaluation score of 4.3/5. 
 
Module development and teaching: Level 3 MEng Design Exercise in Telecommunications (2006).

Academic Leadership  
 
Appointed Director of the UK Research Institute in Secure Hardware and Embedded Systems (RISE), a 
UK wide collaborative initiative, funded by EPSRC and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). My vision 
for the research institute is to create a global centre for research and innovation in hardware security, in close 
collaboration with leading industry and stakeholder partners. A further focus is the translation of RISE research 
outcomes into products, services and business opportunities for the benefit of the UK economy. My aim is to 
establish a strong network of national and international collaborators and research partnerships 
- 
Responsible for the overall budget and the review process for the selection of Research Projects to form 
part of the research institute. Core project partners include the University of Cambridge, Bristol and 
Birmingham. 
- 
I organised a RISE launch event at CSIT, QUB, in November 2017, where the research institute was 
officially launched by Ciaran Martin, Director of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre. 
- 
To bring together the UK community in hardware security, I also organised a 2-day RISE Spring School in 
hardware security at the University of Cambridge, March 2018 and QUB, March 2019.  
 
Initiated a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between RISE/CSIT and the National Research Foundation 
(NRF), Singapore, concerning co-operation in ‘Cybersecurity Research and Development’, March 2018.  
 
Principal Investigator of Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), comprising 10 academics, 15 
post-doc researchers and 22 PhD students. Responsible for developing the CSIT research strategy, holding

 
Technical Director of the Data Security Systems group within CSIT – involved in the direct mentoring, 
management and appraisal of 4 Lecturers, 1 post-doctoral researcher and 5 PhD students, with 1 further post-
doctoral research posts currently advertised. 
 
I have played a key leadership role within CSIT since its establishment and sit on its Senior Management 
Committee. I led the development of future research directions and played an integral role in the proposal 
writing for the successful CSIT Phase 2 EPSRC/TSB funding bid of £5M, which will support the centre from 
2015-2020. I have also co-ordinated the funders’ annual progress reviews. 
 
I co-ordinated CSIT's successful application to be recognised as an EPSRC/GCHQ Academic Centre of 
Excellence in Cyber Security Research in 2012. I was highlighted in the Award letter as being ‘particularly 
important to the work of the academic centre of excellence'. This recognition was successfully renewed in 
2017.  
 
As the School of EEECS SWAN (Scientific Women’s Academic Network) Champion from 2008 to 2015, I 
co-ordinated the School's successful application for an Athena SWAN Silver award in November 2011 and 
assisted with its renewal in April 2015. These awards recognise and celebrate good practice on recruiting, 
retaining and promoting women in SET. 
Awards  
Queen’s Anniversary Prize: In 2015, CSIT was awarded a Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further 
Education. This is a biennial award scheme within the UK’s national honours system and is UK’s most prestigious 
form of national recognition open to a UK academic or vocational institution. CSIT was honoured for its work in 
strengthening global cyber security. 
 
Fellowship Awards 
 EPSRC Leadership Fellowship (£1.2M), 2008-2015 
Awarded across the whole of the EPSRC remit and provided up to five year's funding to talented researchers

List of Publications 
I am either principal supervisor or main author on almost all of the publications listed. Almost all published journal 
papers are in the top decile journals in my main fields of research, Hardware Security and QCA Circuit Design. 
More generally, all of the journal papers fall within the top two quartiles of journals in the broader area of Electrical 
and Electronic Engineering, and all papers published in the last five years fall within the top quartile of such 
journals - based on SCImago Journal & Country Rank.
