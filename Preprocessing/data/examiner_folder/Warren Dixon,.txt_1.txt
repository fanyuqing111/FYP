Newton C. Ebaugh Professor
Prof. Warren Dixon received his Ph.D. in 2000 from the Department of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering from Clemson University. He worked as a research staff member 
and Eugene P. Wigner Fellow at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) until 2004, when he 
joined the University of Florida in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. 
His main research interest has been the development and application of Lyapunov-based 
control techniques for uncertain nonlinear systems. He has published 3 books, an edited 
collection, 13 chapters, and approximately 130 journal and 230 conference papers. His 
work has been recognized by the 2015 & 2009 American Automatic Control Council (AACC) 
O. Hugo Schuck (Best Paper) Award, the 2013 Fred Ellersick Award for Best Overall MILCOM 
Paper, a 2012-2013 University of Florida College of Engineering Doctoral Dissertation 
Mentoring Award, the 2011 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Dynamics 
Systems and Control Division Outstanding Young Investigator Award, the 2006 IEEE Robotics 
and Automation Society (RAS) Early Academic Career Award, an NSF CAREER Award (2006-
2011), the 2004 Department of Energy Outstanding Mentor Award, and the 2001 ORNL 
Early Career Award for Engineering Achievement. He is an ASME Fellow and IEEE Fellow, an 
IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS) Distinguished Lecturer, and served as the Director of 
Operations for the Executive Committee of the IEEE CSS Board of Governors (2012-2015). 
He was awarded the Air Force Commander's Public Service Award (2016) for his 
contributions to the U.S. Air Force Science Advisory Board. He is currently or formerly an 
associate editor for ASME Journal of Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and 
Control, Automatica, IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics: Part B 
Cybernetics, and the International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control.
