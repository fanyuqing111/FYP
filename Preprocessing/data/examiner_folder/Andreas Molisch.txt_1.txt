Biography 
Andy Molisch received his degrees (Dipl.Ing. 1990, PhD 1994, Habilitation 1999) from the Technical University Vienna, Austria. He spent the next 10 years in industry, most 
recently as Chief Wireless Standards Architect at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs. In 2009 he joined the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, CA, as 
Professor, and founded WiDeS. In 2017, he was appointed to the Solomon Golomb – Andrew and Erna Viterbi Chair.
His research interests revolve around wireless propagation channels, wireless systems design, and their interaction. He is particularly interested in wireless channel 
measurement and modeling for 5G and beyond 5G systems, wireless video distribution, hybrid beamforming, UWB/TOA based localization, caching at the wireless edge, 
and novel modulation/multiple access methods. Overall, he has published 4 books (among them the textbook “Wireless Communications”, currently in its second edition), 20 
book chapters, 250 journal papers, and 350 conference papers. He is also the inventor of 60 granted (and more than 20 pending) patents, and co-author of some 70 
standards contributions. He retains a strong interest in bridging academic research and practical applications, real-world standards and products.
Dr. Molisch has been an Editor of a number of journals and special issues, General Chair, Technical Program Committee Chair, or Symposium Chair of multiple international 
conferences, as well as Chairman of various international standardization groups. He is a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, Fellow of the AAAS, Fellow of the 
IEEE, Fellow of the IET, an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer, and a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. He has received numerous awards, among them the IET 
Achievement Medal for Wireless Communications, the Technical Achievement Awards of both the IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (Evans Avant-Garde Award) and the 
IEEE Communications Society (Edwin Howard Armstrong Award), as well as the Technical Field Award of the IEEE for Communications, the Eric Sumner Award. 
Research Summary 
Dr. Molisch's current research interests concentrate on the following areas:
WIRELESS PROPAGATION: As new wireless technologies are introduced, it is vital to understand and model the properties of the wireless propagation channel that are 
relevant for those channels. The well-known conventional channel models (Rayleigh fading, Hata pathloss model) are therefore not sufficient for designing and analyzing 
modern broadband systems. Dr. Molisch is interested in measurement and fundamental modeling techniques for propagation channels for wireless broadband systems – 
from massive MIMO channels, to vehicle-to-vehicle propagation, ultrawideband channels, to mm-wave and THz channels. Hallmark of his work in the area is a holistic 
approach that pays equal attention to conducting measurement campaigns (including construction of required equipment), advanced signal processing for evaluating the 
measurement results, and innovative channel modeling. 
ULTRAWIDEBAND COMMUNICATIONS AND LOCALIZATION: UWB transmission is a physical-layer communication technique that has received enormous interest that is 
of great importance for both high-speed wireless communications and precision localization. Emphasis is on simplified transceiver structures, and localization techniques 
based on time of arrival, including multi-target identification, single-anchor localization, and NLOS identification. 
MULTIPLE ANTENNA TECHNIQUES: Multiple-antenna (MIMO) systems are the best and most efficient way to providing the high data rates and high spectral efficiencies 
that are required for next-generation cellular systems and wireless internet. Dr. Molisch’s research concentrates on 
(i) reducing costs through hybrid beamforming, a technique he invented in 2003, and which is now widely used especially for massive MIMO. 
(ii) improving spectral efficiency and robustness through cooperation between base stations. 
NOVEL MODULATION/MULTIPLE ACCESS METHODS: While MIMO/OFDM/OFDMA has become the standard modulation/multiple access method for modern wireless 
systems, and they are optimum under certain conditions, there are situations in which alternatives are preferable. Dr. Molisch investigates novel approaches ranging from 
novel multi-carrier schemes to multiplexing via Orbital Angular Momenta.
WIRELESS VIDEO DISTRIBUTION: the emergence of wireless video services puts an extra strain on cellular networks. A highly promising method for increasing capacity is 
caching of popular video files either in dedicated helper nodes (“femtocaching”) that replace backhaul with storage, and/or caching in the mobile devices themselves, and 
exchanging them via device-to-device communication when requested. Aspects ranging from physical-layer device-to-device communications to application-layer video 
considerations are being investigated.
