A Bangla clip from ``Sananda", August 15, 2000 
My parents, the late Dr. Maya Mitra (nee Kundoo) and the late
Dr. Girindra Nath Mitra, had the rare privilege of publishing
research articles in ``Nature". They inspired me to achieve;
whatever I am today, I owe it to their immense love and sacrifice
for me.
