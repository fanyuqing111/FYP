People Detail
Professor Russell, Philip - Russell Division
Director of the Russell Division – Photonic Crystal Fibres
Professor Philip Russell is a founding Director of the Max-Planck Institute for the Science of 
Light (MPL), which began operations in January 2009. Since 2005 he has also held the Krupp 
Chair in Experimental Physics at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. He obtained his D.Phil. 
degree in 1979 at the University of Oxford, spending three years as a Research Fellow at Oriel 
College, Oxford. In 1982 and 1983 he was a Humboldt Fellow at the Technical University 
Hamburg-Harburg (Germany), and from 1984 to 1986 he worked at the University of Nice 
(France) and the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. From 1986 
to 1996 he was based mainly at the University of Southampton, first of all in the Optical Fibre 
Group and then in the Optoelectronics Research Centre. From 1996 to 2005 he was professor 
in the Department of Physics at the University of Bath, where he established the Centre for 
Photonics and Photonic Materials. His research interests currently focus on scientific 
applications of photonic crystal fibres and related structures. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society 
and The Optical Society (OSA) and has won several international awards for his research 
including the 2000 OSA Joseph Fraunhofer Award/Robert M. Burley Prize, the 2005 Thomas 
Young Prize of the Institute for Physics (UK), the 2005 Körber Prize for European Science, the 
2013 EPS Prize for Research into the Science of Light, the 2014 Berthold Leibinger 
Zukunftspreis and the 2015 IEEE Photonics Award. He was OSA's President in 2015, the 
International Year of Light.

Curriculum Vitae 
Philip Russell is Director at the Max-Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen, 
Germany and holds the Krupp Chair in Experimental Physics at the University of Erlangen-
Nuremberg. He obtained his M.A. (1976) and D.Phil. (1979) degrees at the University of Oxford 
and subsequently worked in research laboratories and universities in France, Germany and the 
USA. His research interests range from the behaviour of light in periodically structured 
materials to nonlinear optics, waveguides, optical fibres and their applications. He has over 600 
publications and is co-inventor on 37 disclosures or patents covering many aspects of photonics. 
He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and the Optical Society of America (OSA) and has won 
several international awards for his research including the 2005 Körber Prize for European 
Science, the 2005 Thomas Young Prize of the Institute for Physics (UK) and the 2000 OSA 
Joseph Fraunhofer Award/Robert M. Burley Prize. He was a Director-At-Large of the Optical 
Society of America 2007-2009 and from 2005 to 2006 he was an IEEE-LEOS Distinguished 
Lecturer and the recipient of a Royal Society/Wolfson Research Merit Award.
