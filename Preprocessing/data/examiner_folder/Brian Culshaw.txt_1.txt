Prof. Brian Culshaw Director
Brian Culshaw graduated from University College London with a BSc
in Physics and thereafter a PhD in Electronic and Electrical
Engineering, specialising in microwave semiconductors, completed in
1969. He spent 1970 in the US as a post-doc at Cornell, joining the
staff of Bell Northern Research (now Nortel) immediately afterwards
and evolving into microwave system design, especially for long haul
transmission.
He returned to UCL after three years in Ottawa joining the academic
staff at UCL in 1975 thereafter developing an interest in fibre optics
for sensing and measurement. With many co-workers, he produced
some basic results in the use of phase modulation in sensors and the
interferometric architectures to demodulate them. A sabbatical year

with John Shaw at Stanford in 1982 gave an opportunity to contribute
to basic research in fibre gyros. These interests in fibre sensing
evolved into applications in ultrasonics, NDE, smart structures,
advanced materials technologies, environmental sensing and MEMS.
He has founded or co founded three small companies and currently
serves as a director of the two survivors!
He moved to Strathclyde University in Glasgow, where he is currently
professor emeritus, in 1983 as professor of optoelectronics, and since
then has also become involved in a number of professional activities
including multi partner national and international research project
management, conference organisation and journal editing. His work
with professional societies includes serving as President of SPIE
during 2007.
At Strathclyde, he served six years as vice Dean (Engineering) and
completed a five year term as Head of Department.
