EMPLOYMENT 
 
2015-to date: Associate Professor, ECE Department, University of Cyprus. 
2009-2015: Assistant Professor, ECE Department, University of Cyprus. 
2005-2009: Lecturer, ECE Department, University of Cyprus. 
Contributing to the growth and visibility of the Department at the University of Cyprus as well as 
working on the establishment of a research laboratory in the area of mixed-signal integrated system 
design and sensors. 
2004-2005: Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Johns Hopkins University, USA 
Worked with Prof Andreas Andreou in the Sensory Communication and Microsystems Laboratory 
on the development of neuromorphic systems with the use of an experimental 3-D technology, 
provided by MIT Lincoln Labs. The objective of the project was to develop and construct a 
prototype imager/ image transceiver with pixel-level parallel feature extraction. 
2001-2003: Head of Design, Micropower Division, Toumaz Technology Ltd., U.K. 
Being one of the first employees of Toumaz Technology gave me the opportunity to interact with 
customers, manage small design teams and continue my research activities, through an honorary 
research position at Imperial College. This enabled me to lecture a 4th year and M.Sc course, in 
addition to co-supervising postgraduate students at Imperial College, who were sponsored by 
Toumaz.

ECE306 –Electronic Circuits Laboratory  
In this laboratory students initially conduct experiments with discrete components to illustrate their 
limitations. The rest of the course involves using the skills acquired in ECE 305 to design and 
layout, in the Cadence Environment,  a circuit in a commercially available process (AMS 0.35u). In 
2006 the best two designs were fabricated through sponsorship from Cyprus Telecom.
