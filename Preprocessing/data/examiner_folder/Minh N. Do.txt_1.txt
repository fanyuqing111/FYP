Biography
Minh N. Do was born in Thanh Hoa, Vietnam in 1974. He received the B.Eng. degree in
Computer Engineering from the University of Canberra, Australia in 1997, and the Dr.Sci.
degree  in  Communication  Systems  from  the  Swiss  Federal  Institute  of  Technology
Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland in 2001. Since 2002, he has been on the faculty at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he  is currently a  Professor in the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and holds joint appointments with the
Coordinated  Science  Laboratory,  the  Beckman  Institute  for  Advanced  Science  and
Technology, the Advanced Digital Sciences Center, and the Department of Bioengineering.
His current research interests include signal processing, computational imaging, geometric
vision, and data science.
He received a Silver Medal from the 32nd International Mathematical Olympiad in 1991, a
University Medal from the University of Canberra in 1997, a Doctorate Award from the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne in 2001, and a CAREER Award from the
National Science Foundation in 2003. He co-authored on two papers with Arthur L. da
Cunha  and  Ha  T. Nguyen  that  received  Best  Student  Paper  Awards  at  the  IEEE
International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) in 2005,
a paper with Yue Lu that received a Most Innovative Paper Award at the IEEE International
Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) in 2006, and a paper with Yue Lu that received a
Student Paper Award at ICIP in 2007. He received a Young Author Best Paper Award from
the IEEE Signal Processing Society in 2008 for a paper with Martin Vetterli.
He was named a Beckman Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study, UIUC in 2006, and
received a Xerox Award for Faculty Research, College of Engineering, UIUC, in 2007. He
was a member of the IEEE Signal Processing Theory and Methods and Image, Video, and
Multidimensional Signal Processing Technical Committees, and an Associate Editor of the
IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. He was elevated as an IEEE Fellow in 2014 for
contributions to image representation and computational imaging.
