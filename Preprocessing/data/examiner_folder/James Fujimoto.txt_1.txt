Professor James. G. Fujimoto is a principal 
investigator in the Research Laboratory of 
Electronics (RLE) and Department of Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
 He received his S.B., S.M., and Ph.D. in EECS 
from MIT in 1979, 1981, and 1984 respectively. 
 He joined the MIT faculty in 1985 and is 
currently Elihu Thomson Professor of Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and 
Adjunct Professor of Ophthalmology at Tufts 
University School of Medicine.
Professor Fujimoto’s research involves 
biomedical imaging, optical coherence 
tomography (OCT), advanced laser 
technologies and applications in diverse areas 
including ophthalmology, endoscopy, cancer 
detection, surgical guidance and 
developmental biology.  The research team 
was responsible for the invention and 
development of optical coherence tomography 
(OCT). OCT is now considered a standard of 
care in ophthalmology with several 10s of 
million procedures performed per year 
internationally.  The group is continuing 
research on advanced biomedical imaging and 
OCT technology, including high-speed and 
high-resolution imaging, functional Doppler 
flow and angiography as well as polarization 
sensitive methods.  The group investigates 
OCT applications in multiple areas including: 
clinical ophthalmology, endoscopy, small 
animal imaging, pathology laboratory

imaging, developmental biology, 
neurosciences and genetics.  In addition, the 
group has extensive experience in 
femtosecond laser technology and ultrafast 
measurement.
Professor Fujimoto has published over 400 
journal articles, is editor or author of 9 books, 
and holds numerous U.S. patents for his 
discoveries.  He is a fellow of the National 
Academy of Engineering, National Academy of 
Science and American Association for the 
Advancement of Science.  He received the 1999 
Discover Magazine Award for Technological 
Innovation, is co-recipient of the 2001 Rank 
Prize in Optoelectronics, received the 2011 
Zeiss Research Award and is co-recipient of the 
2012 Champalimaud Vision Award.
