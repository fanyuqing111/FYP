L. J. Mawst (M’88–SM’93)was born in Chicago, IL, in 1959. He received the B.S. 
degree in engineering physics and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering 
from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, in 1982, 1984, 
and 1987, respectively. 
 
In 1987, he joined TRW, Inc., Redondo Beach, CA, where he was a Senior Scientist in 
the Research Center, and was engaged in design and development of semiconductor 
lasers using metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) crystal growth. He is 
the coinventor of the resonant optical waveguide (ROW) antiguided array and has 
contributed to its development as a practical source of high coherent power. He 
developed a novel single-mode edge-emitting laser structure, the ARROW laser, as a 
source for coupling high powers into fibers. He is currently a Professor in the 
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Wisconsin-
Madison, Madison, where he is involved in the development of novel III/V compound 
semiconductor device structures, including vertical-cavity surface emitters (VCSELs), 
active photonic lattice structures, InGaAsN lasers, and high-power Al-free diode lasers. 
His current research on low-temperature MOCVD-grown highly strained InGaAs and 
InGaAsN led to record low threshold current density diode lasers. He is the author or 
coauthor of more than 175 technical papers and holds 19 patents. Prof. Mawst received 
the TRW Group Level Chairman’s Award.
