(4) Research Interests 
Our research focuses on developing minimally invasive optical technologies for 
the diagnosis and treatment of disease, particularly for early cancer. It is widely 
believed that the greatest achievement that can be made in cancer management is 
the early detection and subsequent treatment of disease. The next generation cancer 
management strategies require technologies that combine sensing, targeting, and 
treating of the earliest stage disease. Our approach combines optical imaging, 
spectroscopy, and nanotechnology to develop systems capable of combined 
diagnosis and treatment of early cancer. In addition, the lab actively studies the 
basic mechanisms of light-tissue interactions to understand light transport and 
develop novel imaging strategies.
