Dear Prof Wang 
 
Student Ehsan has submitted thesis quite a while. 
All external examiners have signed NDA except Internal examiners declined. 
Do advise how we could proceed. 
 
Thank you and best regards

NTUitive adviced that we should wait until they file the provisional before making it public.

Dear Prof Wang 
 
Some cases initially while filing for patent, they were considered as confidential, but the moment the patent was filed and they got the TD no, then NDA is not required. 
How is Ehsan’s process of filing patent? 
 
Thank you and best regards

I have not imposed NDA requirement but I have to declare confidentiality of patentable materials. I am not sure what the NTU policy and procedure are for such cases. You may 
wish to check relevant office. I am sure there are previous cases. Thanks.

Dear All 
 
I wish to clarify that Ehsan Mihankhah is not a student under RR@NTU Corp Lab. His thesis contains patentable materials which are in the hand of NTUitive.  
 
But Nguyen Viet Hung is a student working in the RR@NTU Corp Lab. 
 
Thanks!
