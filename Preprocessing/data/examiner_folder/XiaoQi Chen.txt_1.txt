37. Sensor-guided robotic welding system for understructure (04/1995-03/1996) 
Funding:  
SGD2,800,000. Singapore Technologies Automotive 
Role:  
Team Leader 
Lead the team in system conceptualization, simulation, prototyping validation, drafting tender 
documents, evaluation of tenders, supervision of system construction and commissioning. The 
sophisticated mechatronic system has multiple sensors for seam tracking in a constrained working 
space, and adaptive process control. It has been deployed to manufacture Infantry Fighting 
Vehicle (IFV) BIONIX for Singapore Arm Force. 
38. Design and development of an integrated shop floor control system (01/1993-06/1994) 
Funding:  
SGD800,000. IBM Singapore Pte Ltd, NSTB 
Role:  
Team Leader 
Lead the team in design of modular fixturing and tooling, and automated fixturing assembly and 
disassembly, and CNC programs. Develop a computer-integrated flexible manufacturing system 
for machining precision mechanical parts. Integrate the Automatic Storage and Retrieval System 
(ASRS), robotic fixturing station, machining centre, Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM), 
and Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV).
