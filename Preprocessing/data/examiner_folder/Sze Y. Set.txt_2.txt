Researcher's Profile
Biography
Research Interests
Since the first demonstrations of the carbon-nanotube (CNT) mode-locked lasers in 2003, over the years, it 
has bloomed into a new field of Nano-Carbon Photonics, using CNT and other nano-carbon materials for 
various laser and photonics applications.
We are interested in developing new industrial applications using these advanced laser pulsed sources, for 
examples (1) High-speed, high-sensitivity optical sampling oscilloscope using special long-wavelength 
femtosecond CNT lasers, for the optical communication industry, and (2) Non-contact, high-precision 3-D 
profile measurement system, using a high-repetition rate short-cavity CNT laser for the automobile industry, 
(3) Short pulse seed lasers for the material processing and laser micro-machining industry.
Our recent research interests include:
· Novel highly-reliable laser mode-locking technique. 
· Integrated optical functional devices using new optical materials.
· Rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers and their applications.
· Applications of short pulse lasers in multidisciplinary research.
Keywords
Short pulse lasers, CNT photonics, ultrafast nonlinear optics, 3D laser measurement
