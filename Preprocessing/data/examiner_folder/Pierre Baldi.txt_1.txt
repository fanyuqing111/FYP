R e s e a r c h  A r e a s
• AI and Machine Learning with particular emphasis on: Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Reinforcement 
Learning, and their Theoretical Foundations and Applications.
• Applications, particularly in the Natural Sciences:
◦ Physics (High-Energy Physics, Cosmology, Quantum Mechanics);
◦ Chemistry (Prediction of Molecular Properties, Prediction of Chemical Reactions, Drug Discovery, 
Chemoinformatics);
◦ Biology (Neuroscience, Circadian Rhythms, Gene Regulation, Omic Sciences, Protein Structure 
Prediction, Bioinformatics, Systems Biology).
The driving interest behind my efforts is to understand natural and artificial intelligence.
