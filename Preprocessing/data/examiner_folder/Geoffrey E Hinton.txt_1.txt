Contributions to Industry
I have consulted for Dragon Systems, DuPont, Apple, Synaptics, Nesbitt-Burns, Ontario Hydro Technologies,
Morphometrics, Athene, Animotion, and Microsoft Redmond. I was on the Technical Advisory Board of the
Microsoft Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK from 2000 to 2006 and on the advisory board of Deepmind
from 2012 to 2014.
I founded a start-up called DNNresearch in November 2012 with two of my graduate students. We sold its
IP to Google in March 2013. Google “DNNresearch” for a large number of media stories.
The deep learning methods for recognizing phonemes in speech and objects in images that were developed in
my group at the University of Toronto have quickly become the standard in both the research community and
industry because they significantly outperform previous methods. They are now used everyday by millions
of people.
Public Dissemination of my Research
In 2012 I taught an eight week Coursera Massive Open Online Course called Neural Networks for Machine
Learning. It had 37,000 registered students at the time and has had many more since then.
I have given three popular Google techtalks:
Brains, Sex and Machine Learning, 2012, (105,000 views)
Recent Developments in Deep Learning, 2009, (70,000 views)
The Next Generation of Neural Networks, 2007, (405,000 views)
Media coverage
My research on deep learning has been described in the New York Times (2012), the Globe and Mail (2012),
Wired Magazine (2014), the Toronto Star (2015), CBC radio (2014 & 2015), the Guardian, UK (2015), and
in many other media outlets. MIT Technology Review named Deep Learning as one of the top 10 innovations
of 2013.
Graduate students
I have been the adviser for 22 completed MSc’s and the following 37 completed PhD’s:
