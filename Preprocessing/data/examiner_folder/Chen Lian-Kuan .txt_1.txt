Biography
Lian-Kuan Chen received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering
from National Taiwan University in 1983 and the M.S. and Ph.D.
degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New
York, in 1992. He joined the faculty of Department of Information
Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and
established the Lightwave Communications Laboratory in1992.
He was the Department Chairman in 2004-2006. In 2007-2013, he
was a member of the engineering panel of Hong Kong
Government Research Grant Council. He served as the director
for the Centre for Advanced Research in Photonics in 2010-2015.
His research includes visible light communication, optical wireless
communication, 
next-generation 
local 
access 
networks,
transmission 
systems, 
optical/electronic 
signal 
processing,
performance monitoring, and bio-photonics. Professor Chen has
published more than 270 papers in referred international
conferences and journals. He is a senior member of IEEE
Photonics Society and Communications Society, and a member of
OSA.  He has served as an associate editor of IEEE Photonics
Technology Letters (2005-2011) and OSA/IEEE Journal of Optical
Communications and Networking (2012-2015).  For his name's
sake (in Chinese), he believes he will continue to engage in
research related to Light in the foreseeable future.
