RESEARCH SPECIALTIES / CAREER: 
 
Summary Statement: 
My research interests lie in the areas of radio systems, electromagnetics, bioelectromagnetics, 
communications and engineering education. Within the areas of radio systems and electromagnetics, 
my research is concentrated on developing improved techniques for prediction of mobile radio path loss, 
on multiple obstacle diffraction loss modelling, on improvements in physical layer modelling of mobile ad 
hoc networks and on weak signal detection including its application in cognitive radio systems. Within the 
area of bioelectromagnetics, my research interests are concerned with evaluation of aspects of the New 
Zealand Radio Frequency (RF) Safety Standard, with the interaction between weak (non-thermal) 
electromagnetic fields and biological tissue and in the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of 
electromagnetic fields. Within the area of engineering education my research is centred on identification 
of threshold concepts in electrical engineering, in the development of intelligent tutoring systems, the 
secondary-to-tertiary transition, the impact of peer-marking, improved academic performance for at-risk 
students, improved diagnostic instruments, identifying strategies for acquainting academic staff with better 
teaching pedagogies and investigation of student learning styles.
