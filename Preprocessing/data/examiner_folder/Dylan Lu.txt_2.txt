 The Scopus Author Identifier assigns a unique number to groups of documents written by the same author via an algorithm that matches authorship based on a certain criteria. If a document cannot be 
confidently matched with an author identifier, it is grouped separately. In this case, you may see more than 1 entry for the same author.
