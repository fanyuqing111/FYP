Title: Effects of Imperfect Secondary Path Modeling on Adaptive Active Noise Control Systems
Author(s): Ardekani, IT (Ardekani, Iman Tabatabaei); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)

Abstract: Implementation of adaptive active noise control (ANC) systems requires an estimate model of the secondary path to be uploaded onto digital
control hardware. In practice, this model is not necessarily perfect; however, to avoid mathematical difficulties, theoretical analysis of these systems is
usually conducted for a perfect secondary path model. This paper conducts a stochastic analysis on performance of Filtered-x LMS (FxLMS)-based ANC
systems when the actual secondary path and its model are not identical. This analysis results in a number of mathematical expressions, describing effects of
a general secondary path model on stability, steady-state performance and convergence speed of FxLMS-based ANC systems. As a surprising result, it is
found that intentional misadjustment of secondary path models can enhance performance of ANC systems in practice. Theoretical results are found to be in
a good agreement with the results obtained from numerical analysis. Also, experimental results confirm the validity and accuracy of the theoretical results.

Title: Hardware-So�ware Codesign of Automatic Speech Recognition System for Embedded Real-Time Applications
Author(s): Cheng, O (Cheng, Octavian); Abdulla, W (Abdulla, Waleed); Salcic, Z (Salcic, Zoran)
Source: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS  Volume: 58  Issue: 3  Pages: 850-859  DOI: 10.1109/TIE.2009.2022520  Published: MAR 2011  
Abstract: We present a hardware-so�ware coprocessing speech recognizer for real-time embedded applications. The system consists of a standard
microprocessor and a hardware accelerator for Gaussian mixture model (GMM) emission probability calculation implemented on a field-programmable gate
array. The GMM accelerator is optimized for timing performance by exploiting data parallelism. In order to avoid large memory requirement, the accelerator
adopts a double buffering scheme for accessing the acoustic parameters with no assumption made on the access pattern of these parameters. Experiments
on widely used benchmark data show that the real-time factor of the proposed system is 0.62, which is about three times faster than the pure so�ware-based
baseline system, while the word accuracy rate is preserved at 93.33%. As a part of the recognizer, a new adaptive beam-pruning algorithm is also proposed
and implemented, which further reduces the average real-time factor to 0.54 with the word accuracy rate of 93.16%. The proposed speech recognizer is
suitable for integration in various types of voice (speech)-controlled applications.

Title: Ambient intelligence platform using multi-agent system and mobile ubiquitous hardware
Author(s): Wang, KIK (Wang, Kevin I-K.); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.); Salcic, Z (Salcic, Zoran)
Source: PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING  Volume: 5  Issue: 5  Pages: 558-573  DOI: 10.1016/j.pmcj.2009.06.003  Published: OCT 2009  
Abstract: In this paper, a novel ambient intelligence (AmI) platform is proposed to facilitate fast integration of different control algorithms, device networks
and user interfaces. This platform defines the overall hardware/so�ware architecture and communication standards. It consists of four layers, namely the
ubiquitous environment, middleware, multi-agent system and application layer. The multi-agent system is implemented using Java Agent DEvelopment
(JADE) framework and allows users to incorporate multiple control algorithms as agents for managing different tasks. The Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
device discovery protocol is used as a middleware, which isolates the multi-agent system and physical ubiquitous environment while providing a standard
communication channel between the two. An XML content language has been designed to provide standard communication between various user interfaces
and the multi-agent system. A mobile ubiquitous setup box is designed to allow fast construction of ubiquitous environments in any physical space. The real
time performance analysis shows the potential of the proposed AmI platform to be used in real-life AmI applications. A case study has also been carried out
to demonstrate the possibility of integrating multiple control algorithms in the multi-agent system and achieving a significant improvement on the overall
offline learning performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: On the stability of adaptation process in active noise control systems
Author(s): Ardekani, IT (Ardekani, Iman Tabatabaei); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)
Source: JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA  Volume: 129  Issue: 1  Pages: 173-184  DOI: 10.1121/1.3514375  Published: JAN 2011  
Abstract: The stability analysis of the adaptation process, performed by the filtered-x least mean square algorithm on weights of active noise controllers, has
not been fully investigated. The main contribution of this paper is conducting a theoretical stability analysis for this process without utilizing commonly used
simplifying assumptions regarding the secondary electro-acoustic channel. The core of this analysis is based on the root locus theory. The general rules for
constructing the root locus plot of the adaptation process are derived by obtaining root locus parameters, including start points, end points, asymptote lines,
and breakaway points. The conducted analysis leads to the derivation of a general upper-bound for the adaptation step-size beyond which the mean weight
vector of the active noise controller becomes unstable. Also, this analysis yields the optimum step-size for which the adaptive active noise controller has its
fastest dynamic performance. The proposed upper-bound and optimum values apply to general secondary electro-acoustic channels, unlike the commonly
used ones which apply to only pure delay channels. The results are found to agree very well with those obtained from numerical analyses and computer
simulation experiments. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3514375]

Title: Filtered weight FxLMS adaptation algorithm: Analysis, design and implementation
Author(s): Ardekani, IT (Ardekani, Iman Tabatabaei); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING  Volume: 25  Issue: 11  Pages: 1023-1037  DOI:
10.1002/acs.1257  Published: NOV 2011  
Abstract: In the Filtered-x Least-Mean-Square (FxLMS)-based Active Noise Control (ANC), the convergence speed of the adaptation process has a direct
relationship to a scalar parameter, called the step size. There is a theoretical upper-bound for the step size beyond which the system becomes unstable.
However, the step size is usually set to a number smaller than its upper-bound in practice. This is because for relatively large step sizes, the adaptation
process becomes very sensitive to any non-stationary change in acoustic noise. Owing to this trade-off, real-time implementation of high-performance ANC
systems becomes challenging. To overcome this problem, this paper develops a novel ANC algorithm in which a recursive filter compensates for influences of
the step size increase on the system performance. It is shown that this filter can efficiently increase the step size upper-bound; consequently, the
performance of the system is improved. This improvement is demonstrated using computer simulation. Also, experimental results shows the preference of
the proposed algorithm to the traditional FxLMS-based ANC algorithm in practice. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Title: Stochastic modelling and analysis of filtered-x least-mean-square adaptation algorithm
Author(s): Ardekani, IT (Ardekani, Iman Tabatabaei); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)

Abstract: This study represents a stochastic model for the adaptation process performed on adaptive control systems by the filtered-x least-mean-square
(FxLMS) algorithm. The main distinction of this model is that it is derived without using conventional simplifying assumptions regarding the physical plant to
be controlled. This model is then used to derive a set of closed-form mathematical expressions for formulating steady-state performance, stability condition
and learning rate of the FxLMS adaptation process. These expressions are the most general expressions, which have been proposed so far. It is shown that
some previously derived expressions can be obtained from the proposed expressions as special and simplified cases. In addition to computer simulations,
different experiments with a real-time control setup confirm the validity of the theoretical findings.

Title: Root locus analysis and design of the adaptation process in active noise control
Author(s): Ardekani, IT (Ardekani, Iman Tabatabaei); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)
Source: JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA  Volume: 132  Issue: 4  Pages: 2313-2324  DOI: 10.1121/1.4746018  Part: 1  Published: OCT
2012  
Abstract: This paper applies root locus theory to develop a graphical tool for the analysis and design of adaptive active noise control systems. It is shown
that the poles of the adaptation process performed in these systems move on typical trajectories in the z-plane as the adaptation step-size varies. Based on
this finding, the dominant root of the adaptation process and its trajectory can be determined. The first contribution of this paper is formulating parameters

-----
of the adaptation process root locus. The next contribution is introducing a mechanism for modifying the trajectory of the dominant root in the root locus.
This mechanism creates a single open loop zero in the original root locus. It is shown that appropriate localization of this zero can cause the dominant root of
the locus to be pushed toward the origin, and thereby the adaptation process becomes faster. The validity of the theoretical findings is confirmed in an
experimental setup which is implemented using real-time multi-threading and multi-core processing techniques. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract: Time-frequency analysis is a way to represent the energy contents of a signal in the joint time-frequency domain. It provides a good visual way to
separate the frequency contents of a multi-component signal, and display the changes of these components with respect to time. This paper outlines
investigative work on neonatal EEG signals using time-frequency analysis. The Cohen's class distributions are discussed, and kernel optimisation for the
Cohen's class distributions is outlined. Segments of EEG with different background continuity states are analysed using a Cohen's class distribution, and
their characteristics are discussed. Through this paper, interesting information that offers insight towards the EEG signal can be visualized from the time
frequency analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: A non-invertible cancellable fingerprint construct based on compact minutiae patterns
Author(s): Krivokuca, V (Krivokuca, Vedrana); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.); Swain, A (Swain, Akshya)
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETRICS  Volume: 6  Issue: 2  Pages: 125-142  DOI: 10.1504/IJBM.2014.060977  Published: 2014  
Abstract: This paper proposes a new, privacy-preserving fingerprint construct, which consists of a single pattern created from a small subset of minutiae
from the corresponding minutiae template. The sparsity of the resulting feature vector ensures that it cannot be used to reconstruct the underlying
fingerprint image, while simultaneously allowing for the cancellability of compromised patterns. The proposed construct is, therefore, inherently a non-
invertible cancellable fingerprint template protection scheme. Experimental results on the recognition accuracy of patterns consisting of three, four, and five
minutiae were very encouraging: an FRR of 0.4% or less was achieved for all three pattern sizes, while the FAR ranged from 2.1% for 5-minutia patterns to
6.5% for 3-minutia patterns. It took about 0.1 seconds to verify a single person, regardless of the pattern size. These results suggest that the proposed
fingerprint construct is suitable for deployment in fingerprint-based civilian authentication applications.

environments.

Abstract: This paper recasts the problem of online secondary path modeling in the form of a statistical inverse problem. A statistical and, in particular, a
Bayesian approach towards secondary path modeling is developed and the computational issues that emerge from this approach are discussed. All signals
and parameters are modeled as random variables and the degree of information concerning them is coded in their probability density functions. An abstract
solution is formulated in the form of a probability density function for the secondary path model. For extracting point estimates, common statistical
estimation methods are investigated. It is shown that maximum likelihood estimation is not stable; however, Bayesian method of maximum a posteriori
gives a reliable solution. An adaptive algorithm is then developed to compute this solution in a computationally efficient manner. This algorithm has three
advantages, compared to the traditional secondary path modeling algorithms. First, it does not cause any interference with the main active noise control
algorithm. Second, it does not require any additive-noise to be injected into the secondary path. Third, it does not require any off-line initiation. The
convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed theoretically. The validity of the theoretical results is investigated by using computer simulation. Finally
successful integration of the proposed algorithm into a real-time ANC system is reported.

Abstract: In this paper a hardware/so�ware co-processing speech recognizer for embedded applications is proposed. The system mainly consists of a
so�core processor and a hardware accelerator The accelerator is responsible for GMM emission probability calculation, which is the major computational
bottleneck. To alleviate the memory bandwidth issue, the hardware accelerator uses double-buffering, which allows parallel operation of data retrieval and
GMM computation. The proposed accelerator is synthesized on an Altera Stratix II FPGA device together with a Nios II so�core processor running at 100MHz.
The proposed system is compared with a pure so�ware-based system using test utterances from the Resource Management (RM1) corpus. For a speech
utterance length of 2.49s, the decoding time reduces from 6.64s to 2.48s. The real-time factor improves from 2.67 to 1.00. The word accuracy rate of the
proposed system on the RM corpus is 93.42%.

Title: A new time-frequency binary mask estimation method based on convex optimization of speech power
Author(s): Bao, F (Bao, Feng); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)
Source: SPEECH COMMUNICATION  Volume: 97  Pages: 51-65  DOI: 10.1016/j.specom.2018.01.002  Published: MAR 2018  
Abstract: In conventional computational auditory scene analysis, the segment segregation and pitch estimation are necessary. However, it is hard to obtain
an accurate pitch contour of clean speech for segregating the segments in low signal-to-noise ratio. This o�en leads to an inaccurate estimation of binary
mask and produces artifacts and temporal discontinuity in the enhanced speech. To overcome this problem, we propose in this paper a new estimation
method for binary mask based on convex optimization of speech power. In this proposed method, the segment segregation and pitch estimation are
excluded and only the speech power of each Gammatone channel is considered as a key cue used for labeling the binary masks. Considering the cross-
correlation between the power spectra of noisy speech and noise in each channel, the objective function of speech power is built, and the speech power is
solved by the gradient descent method. Accordingly, the time-frequency units of speech and noise are labeled by computing a decision factor derived from
the powers of noisy speech, estimated speech and the pre-estimated noise. The erroneous local masks are refined by time-frequency unit smoothing. The
objective measurements including segmental signal-to-noise ratio, HIT-False Alarm rate, the percentage of energy loss and the percentage of noise residue
and the additional subjective listening test demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Available acoustical signal processing algorithms for active noise control (ANC) can only attenuate noise at a finite number of points. Accordingly,
they are unable to create continuous quiet zones in 3-D space. This paper proposes a methodology for developing a family of acoustical signal processing
algorithms that are able to control sound in three dimensions. The theoretical analysis is carried out for spherical quiet zones; however, the proposed
methodology can apply to quiet zones with arbitrary shapes. It is assumed that there is no reflection while sound propagates in media. An arbitrary
frequency spectrum for the noise to be canceled is considered. An optimal control system for 3-D ANC is then derived. Also, an efficient method for the
implementation of the proposed system is developed. The implementation cost of the proposed system is comparable with that of conventional ANC
systems. In addition to the simulation results, different experiments with an experimental ANC system show the validity of the theoretical results.

Abstract: There have been several contributions on theoretical modeling of FxLMS-based active noise control systems; however, when it is intended to derive
elegant closed-form expressions for formulating dynamical behaviors of these systems, a number of simplifying assumptions regarding the acoustic noise,
the actual secondary path and its model have to be used. This paper develops a dynamic model for FxLMS-based ANC systems, considering a general
stochastic acoustic noise and a general secondary path. Also, an arbitrary secondary path model, which is not necessarily a perfect model, is considered. The
main distinction of this model is that previously-derived dynamic models can be resulted in from it as special cases.

Abstract: This paper proposes objective quality measures adopted in speech processing for perceptual quality evaluation of audio watermarking Different
from using an auditory perception model that mimics human auditory system, objective quality measures are introduced as alternative approach to perceive
the dissimilarities caused by audio watermarking. A�er embedding the watermark into a variety of audio signals from EBU database, we calculate the
distance between the watermarked and host signals in terms of several well-developed quality measures. For correlation analysis, subjective listening tests
and a commercial evaluation tool PEMO-Q are also used to grade the differences. Pearson correlation coefficients reveal that the investigated quality
measures, especially Weighted Spectral Slope (WSS) measure, correspond well with reference ratings. Moreover, quality measures run much faster than
PEMO-Q. The results indicate that objective quality measures can be the perceptual quality predictors for audio watermarking.

Title: On Rayleigh distance and absorption length of parametric loudspeakers

Abstract: This paper investigates the propagation of primary and secondary waves produced by parametric loudspeakers of different sizes. The theory of the
parametric acoustic array describes the nonlinear interaction of waves to be confined to the near-field, but the nonlinearities may remain over the far-field,
producing different results. Four simulations were done to compare the performance of loudspeakers with different Rayleigh distances. Based on the
simulations, a new design was proposed to overcome the mismatching of absorption length and Rayleigh distance. Control over these distances is proposed
as an improvement of the performance of the parametric loudspeaker, considering the required scope and proper application.

Title: Recognition accuracy of the new fingerprint construct based on a compact minutiae pattern
Author(s): Krivokuca, V (Krivokuca, Vedrana); Abdulla, W (Abdulla, Waleed)
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETRICS  Volume: 7  Issue: 2  Pages: 170-189  DOI: 10.1504/IJBM.2015.070929  Published: 2015  
Abstract: Instead of using the entire minutiae template to generate a protected fingerprint template, recently a non-invertible cancellable fingerprint
construct based on a 3-5 minutiae pattern was proposed as a safer alternative. This paper investigates the recognition accuracy attainable by this new
fingerprint construct. It is found that using five samples of a person's reference fingerprint and allowing for a maximum of three authentication attempts
provides a genuine user with the best chance of being successfully authenticated. An evaluation of the FAR and FRR in this scenario demonstrates that the
new fingerprint construct can be tuned to suit the performance and security requirements of different applications by adjusting the pattern size and
matching thresholds. The fingerprint construct is then modified to improve its ability to discriminate between genuine users and impostors. Compared to
other non-invertible fingerprint template protection schemes, the performance of the modified fingerprint construct is found to be favourable.

Abstract: A significant challenge in the development of automated fingerprint recognition algorithms is dealing with intra-class variance among multiple
samples of the same fingerprint. A major contributor to this intra-class variance is the inconsistency with which a finger is presented to the fingerprint
scanner across multiple authentication attempts. This paper investigates the consistency of cooperative users in placing their finger on a typical fingerprint
scanner, in terms of the amount of translation and rotation of the finger on the scanner surface and the percentage of reference minutiae that are present in
the query fingerprint during each authentication attempt. A database of 800 fingerprint samples from 100 cooperative participants was collected for this
purpose. Analysis of this database resulted in a median horizontal translation of 13 pixels (0.66 mm), a median vertical translation of 17 pixels (0.86 mm), a
median rotation of 2 degrees, and a median minutiae repeatability of 96.1 %.

Abstract: The high demand for genuine honey leads to fraud practices in the market which have disadvantaged top graded genuine honey production. The
conventional chemical analysis procedures are usually used to ensure the quality and authenticity of honey. Yet, some drawbacks, such as time-consuming,
laborious, invasive and required complex sample preparation, in the chemical approaches make the optical spectrum based honey analysis an
advantageous alternative method. This paper reports a comprehensive survey of peer-reviewed articles in honey analysis using spectroscopy techniques.
The technologies, features, and preprocessing and prediction methods from the observed articles have been discussed to give an overview about optical
spectrum approaches for honey analysis. This paper quickly introduces reseachers to modern honey analysis research.

Title: Adaptive signal processing algorithms for creating spatial zones of quiet
Author(s): Ardekani, IT (Ardekani, Iman Tabatabaei); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)
Source: DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING  Volume: 27  Pages: 129-139  DOI: 10.1016/j.dsp.2014.01.001  Published: APR 2014  
Abstract: Available adaptive active noise control (ANC) algorithms can only minimize the noise level at a point that an error microphone is placed.
Consequently, a zone of quiet around this microphone is produced as a byproduct. However, they cannot technically control or, even, monitor the noise level
within the zone of quiet unless they use several sensors. They cannot also control the shape and the extension of the quiet zone by using only the error
microphone. This paper develops a signal processing framework for the derivation of adaptive ANC algorithms that can directly create a controllable zone of
quiet in monochromatic noise fields using a single error microphone. It is shown that by adding a filter to the standard ANC structure, a controllable zone of
quiet is created. The transfer function of this filter is obtained using an accurate mathematical analysis. It is also shown that the extension of the zone of
quiet can be controlled by tuning this filter. The implementation of the proposed system requires no additional hardware, rather than those required for
traditional ANC systems. The validity of the results are discussed by using numerical analysis. Also, the performance of the proposed system is practically
verified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for creating a frame, to be used as an overcomplete dictionary for the progressive compression of 3D mesh
geometry. The frame is computed from redundant linear combinations of the eigenvectors of a mesh Laplacian matrix, and atoms are selected by a Matching
Pursuit algorithm. Experimental results show that a sparser representation of a given mesh geometry can be obtained with the frame than by decomposition
of the mesh geometry onto an orthogonal basis. The proposed frame also has other desirable properties, including directionality and orientability of the
atoms, and the ability to be applied directly to a manifold mesh with arbitrary topology and connectivity type.

Abstract: A novel approach to extract successful biometrics from mouth visual images is presented in this paper. Visual features are extracted from a
sequence of images of speakers' lips while speaking. These features consist of the shape and intensity of pixels around the edge of the lips as well as their
dynamics. The features are extracted by using particle filters technique to track the movements of the lips. The lips tracker shows adequate accuracy and
ability to maintain lock in different speaking scenarios. Speaker models based on these features are built using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) trained
through the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Satisfactory results are obtained for text-independent speaker recognition carried out on a video
database of 35 individuals. A recognition rate of 82.8% for speaker identification and equal error rate of 18% for speaker verification are achieved using this
technique.

Title: Multiple Scrambling and Adaptive Synchronization for Audio Watermarking

Abstract: Imperceptibility, robustness and security are the vital considerations in the design of any audio watermarking scheme for copyrights protection. In
this paper, a secure and robust audio watermarking scheme involving multiple scrambling and adaptive synchronization is proposed. To prevent the
unauthorized detection, the new scheme integrates multiple scrambling operations into the embedding process. That is, encrypting the watermark with a
coded-image and randomly selecting certain subbands for the embedding process. Moreover, the detection utilizes adaptive synchronization to enhance the
robustness under some destructive de-synchronization attacks, like random samples cropping/inserting, pitch-invariant time stretching, and tempo-
preserved pitch shi�ing. Theoretical analysis and simulation results have revealed that the proposed scheme is self-secured indeed and also immune to a
wide range of severe attacks.

Title: Robust speaker modeling using perceptually motivated feature
Author(s): Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method to extract robust features for text-independent speaker identification from short utterances. This method is
perceptually motivated and inspired by the perceptual linear prediction (PLP) technique. The new feature is called perceptual log area ratio (PLAR). It is
perceptual in the sense that it depends on notions from psychoacoustics where the robustness can be assured. Also, the log area ratio is an effective feature
for recognizing speakers as it embodies the geometry and dynamics of the vocal tract, which are very much person-dependent. This research thus focuses
on providing a reliable vocal biometric from speakers, which can be used effectively with full-band and telephone-band speech in noisy environments.
Intensive performance analysis has been performed to benchmark the proposed method against the commonly-used features using different databases in
different noisy environments. In almost all usable cases the PLAR proved its superiority over the commonly-used features such as MFCC and LPCC. (c) 2007

Abstract: In this paper, a novel multi-agent control system incorporating hybrid intelligence and its physical testbed are presented. The physical testbed is
equipped with a large number of embedded devices interconnected by three types of physical networks. It mimics a ubiquitous intelligent environment and
allows real-time data collection and online system evaluation. Human control behaviours for different physical devices are analysed and classified into three
categories. Physical devices are grouped based on their relevance and each group is assigned to a particular behaviour category. Each device group is
independently modelled by either fuzzy inference or neural network agents according to the behaviour category. Comparative analysis shows that the
proposed multi-agent control system with hybrid intelligence achieves significant improvement in control accuracy compared to other offline control
systems.

Title: Automatic detection and segmentation of optic disc and fovea in retinal images
Author(s): Chalakkal, RJ (Chalakkal, Renoh Johnson); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed Habib); Thulaseedharan, SS (Thulaseedharan, Sinumol Sukumaran)
Source: IET IMAGE PROCESSING  Volume: 12  Issue: 11  Pages: 2100-2110  DOI: 10.1049/iet-ipr.2018.5666  Published: NOV 2018  
Abstract: Feature extraction from retinal images is gaining popularity worldwide as many pathologies are proved having connections with these features.
Automatic detection of these features makes it easier for the specialist ophthalmologists to analyse them without spending exhaustive time to segment
them manually. The proposed method automatically detects the optic disc (OD) using histogram-based template matching combined with the maximum
sum of vessel information in the retinal image. The OD region is segmented by using the circular Hough transform. For detecting fovea, the retinal image is
uniformly divided into three horizontal strips and the strip including the detected OD is selected. Contrast of the horizontal strip containing the OD region is
then enhanced using a series of image processing steps. The macula region is first detected in the OD strip using various morphological operations and
connected component analysis. The fovea is located inside this detected macular region. The proposed method achieves an OD detection accuracy over 95%
upon testing on seven public databases and on our locally developed database, University of Auckland Diabetic Retinopathy database (UoA-DR). The average
OD boundary segmentation overlap score, sensitivity and fovea detection accuracy achieved are 0.86, 0.968 and 97.26% respectively.

Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics  Pages: 31-35  Published: 2017  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new time-frequency mask method for computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) based on convex optimization of
the binary mask. In the proposed method, the pitch estimation and segment segregation in conventional CASA are completely replaced by the convex
optimization of speech power. Considering the cross-correlation between the power spectra of noisy speech and noise in each of a Gammatone filterbank
channel, the objective function of speech power used for convex optimization is built. The speech power is estimated by gradient descent method. Thus, the
time-frequency units dominated by speech and noise are labeled by comparing the powers of noisy and estimated speech, and noise. The erroneous local
masks are also removed by using the Teager energy of the estimated speech and time-frequency unit smoothing. The results from the average segmental
signal-to-noise ratio improvement, HIT-False Alarm rate and subjective test show that the performance of the proposed method outperforms the reference
methods.

Abstract: Segmentation of retinal vessels from retinal fundus images is the key step in the automatic retinal image analysis. In this paper we propose a new
unsupervised automatic method to segment the retinal vessels from retinal fundus images. Contrast enhancement and illumination correction are carried
out through a series of image processing steps followed by adaptive histogram equalization and anisotropic diffusion filtering. This image is then converted
to a gray scale using weighted scaling. The vessel edges are enhanced by boosting the detail curvelet coefficients. Optic disk pixels are removed before
applying fuzzy C-mean classification to avoid the misclassification. Morphological operations and connected component analysis are applied to obtain the
segmented retinal vessels. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using DRIVE database to be able to compare with other state-of-art
supervised and unsupervised methods. The overall segmentation accuracy of the proposed method is 95.18% which outperforms the other algorithms.

Abstract: This paper extends the existing work on the root locus analysis of FxLMS algorithm by considering secondary path modeling errors. Rules for
sketching FxLMS root locus are set out. An analytic convergence condition is then derived from the root locus plot. A deliberately-misaligned secondary path
model is proposed to be used as the data preparation filter in the FxLMS algorithm. The proposed filter increases the computational efficiency of the
algorithm, without changing its convergence behavior. The theoretical results are verified in practice by busing an experimental system.

Title: Fingerprint template protection scheme based on partial minutiae patterns: a comprehensive non-invertibility analysis
Author(s): Krivokuca, V (Krivokuca, Vedrana); Abdulla, W (Abdulla, Waleed)
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETRICS  Volume: 7  Issue: 4  Pages: 326-353  DOI: 10.1504/IJBM.2015.076136  Published: 2015  
Abstract: A crucial property of an effective fingerprint template protection scheme is non-invertibility, which ensures that the original fingerprint template
cannot be recovered from its secured counterpart. Since it is extremely difficult to design a function that achieves a high degree of non-invertibility, it is
unsafe to use an entire fingerprint template as the input to any such function. Most existing fingerprint template protection mechanisms, however, do exactly
this. One scheme that stands apart from the rest, in that its protected template originates from only a small portion of the minutiae template, is a new
fingerprint construct based on partial minutiae patterns. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the non-invertibility of this scheme. It is found that
the new fingerprint construct has extremely strong non-invertibility and good resistance to a Record Multiplicity Attack in practice. We also propose a
modification to improve the method's resistance to this type of attack.

Abstract: This paper concerns about the theoretical stability of the adaptation process performed by the Filtered-x Least Mean Square (FxLMS) algorithm in
active control of acoustic noise. A dynamic model for the Variance of Residual Acoustic Noise (VRAN) is developed and it is shown that the stability of this
model is a sufficient condition for the stability of the adaptation process. The basic rules governing the VRAN root locus are developed, based on which an
upper-bound for the adaptation step-size is derived. This upper-bound can apply to a general case with an arbitrary secondary path, unlike the traditional
upper-bound used in adaptive filter theory, which was derived only for pure delay secondary paths.

Abstract: An efficient noise robust feature is presented to track the speech activity in noisy environments. Speech is modeled by one class of 16 phone-like
Gaussian mixtures while noises are modeled by 15 classes of 6 mixtures each. The feature vector used is a concatenation of carefully selected coefficients
from MFCC, LPCC, and their first and second derivatives. A finite state machine and energy validation components are proposed as post-processor for the
GMM classifier to rectify the misclassified speech segments. The demonstrated speech activity detection system based on our feature detects reliably both
speech and non-speech segments. The designed frame work has been benchmarked against the commercially available codecs G.729, GSM-EFR, MR1, and
MR2. Results show the proposed technique outperforms all these commonly used techniques under various SNR levels and in different noisy environments.

Abstract: A novel Multi-channel Crosstalk Resistant Adaptive Noise Cancellation (MCRANC) algorithm is presented in this paper to enhance noise carrying
speech signals. The algorithm would permit locating the microphones in close proximity as it cancels out the crosstalk effect. Results have indicated that this
method outperforms the commonly used techniques in the sense of SNR improvement and speech intelligibility. A SNR improvement of 17.8dB using
MCRANC keeping highly intelligible speech was achieved in our experiments versus 9.1dB using Multi-channel ANC (MANC) with far less speech quality.

Abstract: Feature extraction is the key procedure when aiming at robust speaker identification. The most commonly used feature extraction techniques work
successfully only in clean or matched environments. Accurate speaker identification is made difficult due to a number of factors, with handset/channel
mismatch and environmental noise being the most prominent. This paper presents a novel technique which based on Gammatone filterbank (GTF) and
independent component analysis (ICA). The presented method first relies on the Gammatone filterbank to emulate the human cochlea frequency resolution.
By using ICA, it extracts the dominant components from these frequency banks. The extracted features emphasis the difference in the statistical structures
among the speakers, which can model the distribution of the individuals. Compared to the commonly used techniques, such as linear predictive cepstral
coefficients (LPCC), Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) and perceptual linear predictive (PLP), the proposed method is more robust to additive
noises and yields higher recognition rate in mismatch environments in a text-independent speaker identification system.

Title: Segmentation and calibration of hyperspectral imaging for honey analysis
Author(s): Noviyanto, A (Noviyanto, Ary); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)
Source: COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE  Volume: 159  Pages: 129-139  DOI: 10.1016/j.compag.2019.02.006  Published: APR 2019  
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging as a fast and non-invasive method for honey analysis has great potential to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional
chemically based assessment methods. This paper discusses segmentation and calibration techniques to acquire accurate and consistent spectra in the
implementation of hyperspectral imaging. These essential techniques have not yet been fully investigated despite they have significant implications over the
honey analysis accuracy. Those techniques were developed and assessed under reflectance and transmittance sensing modes. The developed segmentation
strategies (manual and automatic) followed by a selective average function demonstrated a reliable spectra extraction of honey samples. The developed
calibration technique using a dynamic reference followed by normalisation successfully corrected the extracted spectra from distortions caused by variations
in temperatures and lighting powers; also it greatly reduced the effect of spatial heterogeneity. The proposed segmentation and calibration techniques
ensure the repeatability of spectral information acquisition which is very important for further processing to develop machine learning and statistically
based prediction models.

Title: A New Ratio Mask Representation for CASA-Based Speech Enhancement
Author(s): Bao, F (Bao, Feng); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)
Source: IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING  Volume: 27  Issue: 1  Pages: 7-19  DOI:
10.1109/TASLP.2018.2868407  Published: JAN 2019  
Abstract: In the computational auditory scene analysis method, the ideal ratio mask or alternatively the ideal binary mask is the key point to reconstruct the
enhanced signal. The ratio mask in its Wiener filtering or its square root form is currently considered. However, this kind of ratio mask overlooked one
important issue. It does not exploit the inter-channel correlation (ICC) in the noisy speech, noise, and clean speech spectra. Thus, in this paper, we first
propose a novel ratio mask representation by utilizing the ICC. In this way, we adaptively reallocate the power ratio of the speech and noise during the
construction of ratio mask, thus, more speech and noise components are retained and masked at the same time, respectively. Second, the channel-weight
contour based on the equal loudness hearing attribute is adopted to revise this new ratio mask in each Gammatone filterbank channel. Finally, the revised
ratio mask is effectively used to train a five-layer structured deep neural network. Experiments show that the proposed ratio mask performs better than the
conventional ratio mask representation and other series of enhancement algorithms in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and spectral distortion under
different signal to noise ratio conditions using six types of noises.

Title: Noise masking method based on an effective ratio mask estimation in Gammatone channels
Author(s): Bao, F (Bao, Feng); Abdulla, WH (Abdulla, Waleed H.)

Abstract: In computational auditory scene analysis, the accurate estimation of binary mask or ratio mask plays a key role in noise masking. An inaccurate
estimation o�en leads to some artifacts and temporal discontinuity in the synthesized speech. To overcome this problem, we propose a new ratio mask
estimation method in terms of Wiener filtering in each Gammatone channel. In the reconstruction of Wiener filter, we utilize the relationship of the speech
and noise power spectra in each Gammatone channel to build the objective function for the convex optimization of speech power. To improve the accuracy
of estimation, the estimated ratio mask is further modified based on its adjacent time-frequency units, and then smoothed by interpolating with the
estimated binary masks. The objective tests including the signal-to-noise ratio improvement, spectral distortion and intelligibility, and subjective listening
test demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the reference methods.

Abstract: Efficient training target plays a vital role in any training model for speech enhancement. In the Computational Auditory Scene Analysis method
based on Deep Neural Networks, the ideal ratio mask or square-root ideal ratio mask is usually considered as the effective training target. In this paper, we
propose a novel training target method for speech enhancement. This new training target takes into consideration the inter channel correlations of the
power spectra of the noisy speech, clean speech and noise to more efficiently retain speech components and mask the noise components. Additionally, the
channel-weight contour based on the equal loudness hearing attribute is introduced to revise the training target in each Gammatone channel to make the
resynthesized signal more suitable for hearing characteristics. Moreover, the training target is smoothed to further improve the accuracy. Experiments show
that using the proposed training target achieves better performances in terms of speech quality and intelligibility.

Title: Progressive Compression of 3D Mesh Geometry Using Sparse Approximations from Redundant Frame Dictionaries

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach for the progressive compression of three-dimensional (3D) mesh geometry using redundant frame
dictionaries and sparse approximation techniques. We construct the proposed frames from redundant linear combinations of the eigenvectors of a
combinatorial mesh Laplacian matrix. We achieve a sparse synthesis of the mesh geometry by selecting atoms from a frame using matching pursuit.
Experimental results show that the resulting ratedistortion performance compares favorably with other progressive mesh compression algorithms in the
same category, even when a very simple, sub-optimal encoding strategy is used for the transmitted data. The proposed frames also have the desirable
property of being able to be applied directly to a manifold mesh having arbitrary topology and connectivity types; thus, no initial remeshing is required and
the original mesh connectivity is preserved.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple technique for extrapolating the spectra of speech signal based on real zero crossings and higher order crossings
(HOC). In this approach, the speech signal is first subjected to a sequence of difference/sum filtering. 'then counts of zero crossings are calculated over short
overlapped frames to obtain a sequence of counts. This sequence represents the dominant frequency components of the speech signal over the analysis
frames. The HOC based spectral characteristics are found to be distinct for each utterance. To evaluate the discrimination performance of the HOC counts, we
consider them as feature vectors to train a speech recognition system. We found that the recognition rate achieved by using the HOC feature is comparable to
what can he achieved by the commonly used mel frequency cepstral coefficients, which is more computationally expensive. This paper would pave the road
for more extensive work on the HOC features and variants as applied to speech signals.

Abstract: Although the state-of-the-art single-channel speech enhancement algorithms has gained an appreciable suppression of the noise and improved
speech quality to some extent, they are not mostly oriented toward improving the intelligibility of noise-degraded speech signal. In this paper, we propose a
novel noise masking method based on convex optimization of the clean speech power to target the enhanced signal intelligibility. In our proposed method,
the speech signal is analyzed in Gammatone domain instead of Short-Time Fourier Transform domain. The clean speech power is estimated by the convex

optimization algorithm. The ratio mask used to resynthesize speech is estimated by the powers of the estimated clean speech and noise. The combination of
the binary mask and ratio mask contributes to a further improvement of the performance. We evaluated the enhancement results for the proposed method
using objective and subjective measures. We show that the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the reference methods.

The essential missing component to kick start this research is a standard honey hyperspectral images, called hypercubes, dataset. This paper proposes a

is introduced to ease the interaction between raw hypercube data and machine learning so�ware. The developed dataset greatly benefits researchers to
progress on the research of honey analysis including constituents prediction and types classification using hyperspectral imaging and machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel noise masking method based on Computational Auditory Scene Analysis by using an adaptive factor. Although it
has succeeded in the field of speech separation and speech enhancement to some extent, the usage of fixed thresholds used for segregation and labeling
heavily affects the processing performance. Focusing on this issue, the proposed method utilizes the Normalized Cross-Correlation Coefficients between the
power spectra of noisy speech and pure noise to find an adaptive threshold, so that the pitch contour and Time-Frequency units can be obtained more
accurately. Then, a revised algorithm is used to smooth the current binary mask value by checking the Time-Frequency units within adjacent frames and
neighbor channels around the current Time-Frequency unit in order to remove the erroneous local masks. Two kinds of Signal to Noise Ratio test results
show that the performance of the proposed method outperforms conventional spectral subtractive, Wiener Filtering and Computational Auditory Scene
Analysis methods.

Title: Cancellability and diversity analysis of fingerprint template protection scheme based on compact minutiae pattern

Source: INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL  Volume: 25  Issue: 1-3  Pages: 109-123  DOI: 10.1080/19393555.2016.1179375  Published: 2016  
Abstract: As fingerprints continue toward ubiquity in human recognition applications, growing fingerprint databases will pose an increasingly greater risk of
irreversible identity the� in the event of a database breach. Consequently, more focus is being placed on researching new and effective ways of securing
fingerprint templates during database storage. Recently, a new fingerprint template protection scheme, based on representing a fingerprint by a sparse 3-,
4-, or 5-minutiae pattern, has been proposed. The most important advantage of this method over other fingerprint template protection schemes is that it
employs only a small number of identifying features in the creation of the protected template, such that it is impossible to recover the original fingerprint
even if the protected template is compromised. In this article, we present a thorough analysis to demonstrate that this new fingerprint construct also boasts
impressive cancellability and diversity properties. Cancellability allows for the replacement of a compromised template with a new template from the same
fingerprint, and diversity enables a person to enroll into multiple applications using the same fingerprint without the prospect of being tracked across the
different applications.

Title: Noninvertible fingerprint transforms: Categorization of design mechanisms and discussion of evaluation techniques

Abstract: The explosive growth in fingerprint technologies within the past decade has seen the emergence of a dedicated field of research into securing
fingerprint templates during storage in a database. While new fingerprint template protection techniques are o�en broadly classified as belonging to the
well-known salting, noninvertible transforms, key binding, or key generation categories, methods within each category are currently lacking a sense of
organization. This article aims to fill this gap by proposing a categorization of noninvertible fingerprint transforms based on their design mechanisms. Our
survey of the current literature in this field reveals two prominent types of approaches, so we classify existing noninvertible fingerprint transforms into two
main categories: perturbation-based and histogram-based. We also discuss the evaluation techniques used to assess the robustness of noninvertible
fingerprint transforms in the literature. These contributions will serve to help researchers find their bearing in the growing fingerprint template protection
field, thereby encouraging a deeper understanding of the field and faster progress in the development of more effective fingerprint template protection
schemes.

Abstract: Motivated by the inherent correlation between the speech features and their lexical words, we propose in this paper a new framework for learning
the parameters of the corresponding acoustic and language models jointly. The proposed framework is based on discriminative training of the models'
parameters using minimum classification error criterion. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a set of four large decoding graphs is
constructed using weighted finite-state transducers as a composition of two sets of context-dependent acousticmodels and two sets of n-gram-based
languagemodels. The experimental results conducted on this set of decoding graphs validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework when compared
with four baseline systems based on maximum likelihood estimation and separate discriminative training of acoustic and language models in benchmark
testing of two speech corpora, namely TIMIT and RM1.

Abstract: Available adaptive control algorithms can only create a silent point at the locations of an error microphone. In this case, the error microphone
occupies a part of the zone of quiet established around the silent point, resulting in an ineffective use of space in the zone of quiet. This paper develops a
novel adaptive control algorithm for active control of sound in remote locations rather than the locations of error microphones. It establishes a link between
the performance of the FxLMS adaptive algorithm in the digital control domain and the performance of the active noise control mechanism in the acoustic
domain. The transfer function of an optimal controller that can minimize the acoustic pressure in a location away from the error microphone is first derived.
For the realization of the proposed controller, an adaptive algorithm, called Remote FxLMS is then developed. Different computer simulations are used to
show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
