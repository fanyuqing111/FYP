Biography
Professor Sin was born in Hong Kong. He received his BASc (1981), MASc (1983), and PhD (1988) degrees, all in Electrical 
Engineering, from the University of Toronto in Canada. He joined Philips Laboratories, New York, USA, upon the completion 
of his PhD studies, and was a senior member of the research staff there from 1988–1991. Professor Sin joined the 
Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 
August 1991 as an assistant professor and was promoted to full professor in 2001. He is one of the founding members of 
the Department, and has served as the Director of the Undergraduate Studies program in the Department from 1998 to 
2004. In Fall 1998, he was awarded the Teaching Excellence Appreciation Award by the School of Engineering at the 
University. He was the director of the Nanoelectronics Fabrication Facility from 2003 to 2012, and has been the director of 
the SPADE (Semiconductor Product Analysis and Design Enhancement) Center since 2001: a semiconductor failure analysis 
facility at the University to serve the semiconductor industry. Professor Sin is the holder of 13 patents, and has published 
over 260 papers in technical journals and refereed conferences. Professor Sin was an Editor of IEEE Electron Device Letters 
from 1998 to 2010. He has been a member of the IEEE Electron Devices Society Administrative Committee (Power Devices 
Sub-committee) since 1998. He has served as technical committee member of the International Symposium on Power 
Semiconductor Devices and IC’s (ISPSD) since 1999. He is a Fellow of IEEE for contributions to the design and 
commercialization of power semiconductor devices.
