Introduction 
I received my B.S. and M.S. from Fudan University, 
Shanghai, P. R. China, in 1992 and 1995 respectively and 
the Ph.D. from University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 1999. 
Currently I am Professor at Department of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering. Here are my latest curriculum 
vitae and short biography and my publication list.
I am the director of VLSI System and Computation Lab 
(VSC Lab) at UC Riverside. I am also the associate 
director for the Computer Engineering Program at 
Bourns College of Engineering. I am also a cooperating 
faculty member (co-faculty) of the Computer Science and 
Engineering department at Bourns College of 
Engineering.
In addition, I am the Editor in Chief (EIC) of Integration, 
The VLSI Journal, which is one of the primary journals 
in the VLSI design and CAD/design automation areas.
