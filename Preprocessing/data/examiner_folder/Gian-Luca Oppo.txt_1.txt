Biography
Gian-Luca Oppo is Professor of Computational and Nonlinear Physics at the University of Strathclyde since 1998
and the director of the Institute of Complex Systems since 2007. Oppo graduated at the National Institute of
Optics in Florence (Italy) in 1983 and joined the University of Strathclyde in 1989 after research work at the
Universities of Toronto (Canada), Drexel (Philadelphia, USA) and Nice (France). Oppo was awarded the
Occhialini medal and prize in 2011 from the Institute of Physics and the Italian Physical Society, a Senior
Research Fellowship from the Royal Society – Leverhulme Trust in 2003, a fellowship of the Centre for Complex
Dynamics of the University of Florence in 2005 and the Silicon Graphics International Fellowship from 2000 to
2005.  Oppo is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2012), Optical Society of America (1999) and of the
Institute of Physics (1997). Oppo is author of more than 140 publications in peer-review journals and books.
