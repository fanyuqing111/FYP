BACKGROUND 
Krish Chakrabarty has been at Duke University since 1998. His current research is focused on: 
testing and design-for-testability of integrated circuits (especially 3D and multicore chips); digital 
microfluidics, biochips, and cyberphysical systems; optimization of digital print and production 
system infrastructure. His research projects in the recent past have also included chip cooling 
using digital microfluidics, wireless sensor networks, and real-time embedded systems. Research 
support is provided by the National Science Foundation, the Semiconductor Research 
Corporation, Cisco Systems, HP Labs, Huawei Technologies, and Intel Corporation through Intel 
Lab's Academic Research Office. Other sponsors in the past have included National Institutes of 
Health , DARPA and the Office of Naval Research. 
Prof. Chakrabarty is a recipient of the 1999 National Science Foundation Early Faculty 
(CAREER) Award, the 2001 Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award, the Mercator
