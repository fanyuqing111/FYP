Dr. Frederik Krebs is a professor and head of section of the Solar Energy 
group at DTU Energy. Frederik has done research in the field of different 
solar cells for more than a decade and his main research interest is stability, 
material research and more recently large scale processing. He has 
published more than 300 papers in the field and is recognized throughout 
the international PV community, especially for organic photovoltaics.
