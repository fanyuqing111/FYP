Hi Prof. See and all,  
 
We already received approval from RR‐PCC system and it is now available for public viewing. We just got some minor 
correction for the dissertation. I will consult with Liu Yong to sort out this issue and including some comments from my 
side for improvement this dissertation.  So, I don’t think unsigned NDA is an issue now.

Dear all, 
  
I hope all these matters can be resolved soon. We have to be fair with the PhD students, who have contributed to the Corp 
Lab but being penalised with all these red tape.

Dear Amit, Michael, Rejeki and Josep, 
  
Seems to me that there is a difficulty to have a common slot for us to meet together. To expedite the examination of these 
students, I summarize on the table below the situation of the two students who have submitted their thesis more than 3 
months ago. We wish to reach a common understanding to avoid further delay. Pls advise and/or confirm the decision or 
what needs to be done (highlighted in yellow below). Please kindly help to expedite the examination and avoid further 
delay. Thank you for your understanding.

Case 1 
Student : 
Liu Yong (G1402567H) 
DOA 
August 2014 
Thesis 
Title : 
Compact Filter Design for High Power Density Converter 
Supervisor 
: 
See Kye Yak 
Status : 
1) All Examiners signed NDA except:  
- Internal Examiner who declined to sign NDA, AND email from Dr 
Abundo (Legal Office). The internal examiner view is that the student 
has already published several research papers, and he can present these 
published research works in his PhD oral defence.  
  
- Chairman declined to sign NDA, BUT agreed on the email from Dr 
Abundo (Legal Office)  
  
- Email from Dr Abundo  
<< Message: RE: Meeting : Non-Disclosure Agreement for EEE PhD 
Postgraduates under Rolls-Royce >>  
2) Dr Amit mentioned in an email that the internal examiner need not 
sign NDA  
  
  
3) Dr Rejeki Simanjorang indicated the need to get clearance from RR 
PCC systems in UK.  
<< Message: RE: Meeting : Non-Disclosure Agreement for EEE PhD 
Postgraduates under Rolls-Royce >>  
Questions:  
  
  
  
  
  
1) Based on the Rejeki email above we still need to get clearance 
from RR PCC.  
Pls confirm. 
  
  
2) Based on Dr Amit’s email, the internal examiner is not required 
to sign NDA nor to give email acknowledgement on the management 
of confidential information in the Letter of Appointment. 
  
Pls kindly confirm. We need to avoid a situation whereby when we 
get approval from RR PCC we still have to change the examiner. If 
we need to change the examiner we do it now, but not easy. 
  
 
Case 2 
Student : 
Nguyen Viet Hung (G1300506K) 
DOA 
August 2013 

-----
4
Thesis Title 
: 
Model-Based Diagnosis and Prognosis of Induction Machines under 
Stator Winding Inter-Turn Short Fault  
  
Supervisor 
: 
Wang Dan Wei 
Status : 
1) All Examiners have signed NDA  
  
Questions: 
Given that all examiners have signed NDA, the thesis is ready to be 
sent to the examiners. Based on the above case, is the clearance from 
RR PCC still required? If yes, it will cause further delay. Pls advise.

I feel that we need to close the loop on this NDA matter. The email below is with Dr Abundo. On the other hand there are 
emails on NDA with Amit Gupta. However, I notice that Amit Gupta is not in cc in the emails from Abundo and vice versa.

Dear Harwati, 
  
The Internal Examiners are strongly encouraged to sign the NDA. But if they refuse to do so, please abide by Mee Kim’s 
guidance to inform the examiners (who are NTU faculty): 
  
inform the individual examiners that all information disclosed during the qualifying examination are to be considered as 
Confidential Information and they are to comply with their terms of appointment with respect to the management of 
confidential information as extracted below (from the Letter of Appointment): 
  
You shall not, at any time before or after the termination of your appointment, for whatever cause, use, reproduce, disclose, 
retain in your possession or control or communicate directly or indirectly to any person other than a person to whom you are 
authorised by the University to communicate and for a purpose authorised by the University, any document (in written or 
other form) or information in any form of a nature which is confidential, sensitive or proprietary to the University and its 
subsidiaries or information received from third parties by the University under obligations of confidentiality (“Confidential 
Information”) and you shall indemnify and keep indemnified the University and its subsidiaries against all losses, costs and 
expenses arising therefrom.

Please send this to them and have them acknowledge via email that they have read and understood the terms of their 
Letter of Appointment Do send me a copy of their acknowledgement once done (this will suffice in place of a signed 
NDA). 
  
Thanks, 
  
Mike

Dear Prof Josep Pou and Dr Abundo 
  
We seriously hope to resolve this issue of EEE staff need to sign NDA when examining thesis from RR@NTU Corp lab. 
The students’ thesis has been pending on our side for quite a long time. 
  
We seek your confirmation that as long as faculty staff are involved in the RR@NTU Corp lab, they are not required to sign 
NDA when they examine RR@NTU Corp Lab. 
  
Also, from Wong Mee Kim’s email attached, I extracted some points below on EEE examiners refusing to sign NDA: 
  
We would recommend for the Undertaking to be put in place with the internal examiners so that we have signed 
acknowledgements that they understand their confidentiality obligations under the RRCorpLab RCA. However, if the EEE 
examiners still refuse to sign off on the Undertakings, RRCorpLab could instead inform the individual examiners that all 
information disclosed during the qualifying examination are to be considered as Confidential Information and they are to 
comply with their terms of appointment with respect to the management of confidential information as extracted below 
(from the Letter of Appointment): 
  
You shall not, at any time before or after the termination of your appointment, for whatever cause, use, reproduce, disclose, 
retain in your possession or control or communicate directly or indirectly to any person other than a person to whom you are 
authorised by the University to communicate and for a purpose authorised by the University, any document (in written or 
other form) or information in any form of a nature which is confidential, sensitive or proprietary to the University and its 
subsidiaries or information received from third parties by the University under obligations of confidentiality (“Confidential 
Information”) and you shall indemnify and keep indemnified the University and its subsidiaries against all losses, costs and 
expenses arising therefrom. 
  
  
To move on, we hope to have your confirmation reply the soonest.
