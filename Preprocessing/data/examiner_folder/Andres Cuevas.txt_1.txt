Dr. Andres Cuevas, Fellow IEEE,PhD (Univ Politecnica Madrid, 1980), M Eng 
(Telecommunications, U. Pol. Madrid, 1976)has held academic positions at the universities 
of Madrid (PhD 1980), Stanford (Fulbright Fellow 1989) and ANU (since 1993). He has 
contributed to the scientific and technological advancement of silicon solar cells via more 
than 20 research projects and 330 publications. His work spans from the pursuit of the 
fundamental limits to bulk and surface recombination in crystalline silicon to the 
development of advanced device structures and fabrication processes. His current research 
focusses on carrier-selective, passivated contact systems and heterojunctions for a new 
generation of high performance silicon solar cells.
