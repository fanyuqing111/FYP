Eduardo Antônio Barros da Silva was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1963.
He got his B.Sc in Engineering from Instituto Militar de Engenharia (IME) in
1984, his M.Sc in Electrical Engineer from COPPE/UFRJ in 1990 and his Ph.D
in Electronics Systems Engineering from Essex University,England in 1995.
In 1985 he worked has an engineer for EMBRATEL (a Brazilian
Telecommunications Holding). In 1986 he worked as an engineer for IBM-
Brazil. In 1987 and 1988 he worked at the Departament of Electrical
Engineering of Instituto Militar de Engenharia (IME), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Since 1989 he works at the Electronics and Computer Science Departament
from Escola Politécnica (former Escola de Engenharia), from Universidade
Federal do Rio de Janeiro(UFRJ). He was coordinator of the specialization
course in Telecomunication Systems from Escola Politécnica (TELECOM) from
2003 to 2008. He also works since 1996 at the Programa de Engenharia Elétrica
from COPPE/UFRJ, where he was Head of Department in 2002. 
In 2002, 2003 and 2008 and 2009 he has been Associate Editor of IEEE
Transactions on Circuits and systems, Part I, in the area of Digital Filters,
Wavelets and Filter Banks. In 2006 and 2007 he has been Associate Editor of
IEEE Transactions on Circuits and systems, Part II, in the area of Digital Signal
Processing, and has been Associate Editor of the Journal Multidimensional
Systems and Signal Processing, from Springer Verlag, since 2006.
He gives consulting and trainning in Image and Video Compression for TV
operators in Brazil. In 1994 he won the "British Telecom Postgraduate
Publication Prize" for his IEEE article on Aliasing in Subband Coding. He has
been appointed a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE CAS Society for 2003 and
2004. He also is co-author of the book "Digital Signal Processing - System
Analysis and Design", published by Cambridge University Press. His research
