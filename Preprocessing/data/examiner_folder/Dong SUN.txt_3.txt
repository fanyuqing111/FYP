About Scopus Author Id
The Scopus Author Identifier assigns a unique number to groups of documents written by the same author via an algorithm that matches authorship based on
certain criteria. If a document cannot be confidently matched with an author identifier, it is grouped separately. In this case, you may see more than one entry 
the same author.
