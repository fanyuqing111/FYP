International Univ (FIU).  He is an IEEE and ACES Fellow. Prior to coming to FIU, he 
was the Roy and Lois Chope Chair in Engineering at Ohio State and a Professor in the 
Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept. (2003-2017). He also served as the 
Director of the Ohio State Univ. ElectroScience Laboratory for 14 years.
His career spans 2 years at Boeing, 19 years on the faculty at the Univ of Michigan 
and 15 years at Ohio State. At Michigan he served as the Director of the Radiation 
Laboratory at U of Michigan (1998-2000). He has 35 years of experience and his 
research covers wireless communications, wearable textile antennas and 
electronics, antenna and arrays, ultra-wideband RF beamforming techniques, RF 
materials and metamaterials, EMI/EMC, multi-physics engineering, 
bioelectromagnetics, mm-wave front ends for GB communications, THz, radar 
scattering, RF systems integration, propagation, design optimization, and 
computational methods. He is internationally known for introducing hybrid finite 
element methods in electromagnetics, antenna miniaturizations techniques and 
textile electronics.  In 2004, he was listed by ISI among the top 250 highly cited 
scientists/engineers.  His publications include 8 widely used books, 400 journal 
papers and nearly 800 conference papers. As of May 2017, his google h-index=60 
with nearly 16000 citations. He mentored nearly 90 Ph.Ds with 37 of them having 
won awards at international conferences.
His service to Professional Societies includes: 2004 President of the IEEE Antennas 
and Propagation Society, 2015-2017 USNC-URSI B Chair, twice the general Chair of 
the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Symposium, IEEE APS Distinguished Lecturer, 
IEEE APS Fellows Committee Chair, IEEE-wide Fellows committee member &
