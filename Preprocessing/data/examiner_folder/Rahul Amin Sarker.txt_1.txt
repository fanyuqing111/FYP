Ruhul A Sarker obtained his Ph.D. from Dalhousie University (former TUNS), Canada. He is a 
Professor in the School of Engineering and IT, and the Director of Faculty PG Research at UNSW 
Canbarra (located at ADFA), Australia. Prof. Sarker’s broad research interests are decision 
analytics, CI / evolutionary computation, operations research, and applied optimization.
For Future Research Students: Ph.D. scholarships are available for high achieving students 
(with H1 /High Distinction in UG and Masters by Research) in Computer Science, Information 
Sciences, Operations Research, or Industrial Engineering under my supervision. If you are 
interested contact me at r.sarker@adfa.edu.au
Theoretical Research: Design and development of algorithms for solving complex decision and 
optimization problems. It covers computational intelligence, population based search algorithms 
(such as evolutionary algorithms) as well as conventional search algorithms. The problem areas 
include structured (single and multi-objective optimization with or without functional contraints), 
semi-structured and unstructured problems. 
Applied Research Areas: supply chain (design, bottleneck, shipping, and disruption recovery), 
mining (mine scheduling, coal mining and petroleum production planning), manufacturing (layout 
and location, production planning, and scheduling), agriculture (crop planning, and land 
allocation), power generation planning, resource constrained project scheduling, and defence 
(planning, and performance evaluation).   
Professional Engagement: Prof. Sarker is an editor of the Journal of Flexible Service and 
Manufacturing, an associate editor of the Journal of Memetic Computing, an editor of the Journal 
of Industrial and management Optimization, and former editor-in-chief of ASOR Bulletin. He had 
led the technical committee for IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation in 2003 and was a 
proceeding co-chair of IEEE WCCI'2012.
Publications: Prof. Sarker is the lead author of the book ‘Optimization Modelling: A Practical 
Approach’ published by Taylor & Francis /CRC Press. He has edited /co-edited 8 books, on 
specialised topics in his areas of research, published by the leading publishers. He has 250+ 
refereed publications including 100+ journal papers. His research has received a number of 
international media coverages. Some of these media are: Wall Street Journal, ScienceDaily, 
United Press International (UPI), Times of the Internet,TerraDaily, MarketWatch, EcoEarth, 
Eurocean, Softpedia, Oneindia, ScienceBlog. For publication detals, visit:

Funding: Prof. Sarker has successfully obtained significant external funding for his research that 
includes Australian Research Council, Defence Science and Technology Organisation and 
Industry. Recent ARC Discovery Projects:
-- R. Sarker, D. Essam and C. Coello Coello (2017-19) Reactive Planning under Disruptions and
