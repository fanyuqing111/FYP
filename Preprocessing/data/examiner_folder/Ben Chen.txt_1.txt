computer science from Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China, in 
July 1983, an M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Gonzaga 
University, Spokane, Washington, USA, in May 1988, and a Ph.D. 
degree in electrical & computer engineering from Washington State 
University, Pullman, Washington, USA, in August 1991. 
I was a software engineer in the South-China Computer Corporation, Guangzhou, China, from 
July 1983 to March 1986. I held a Presidential Scholarship at Gonzaga University from 1986 to 
1988, and a Cardinal Yu-Pin Scholarship from the Sino-American Amity Fund, New York, from

I have been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the National 
University of Singapore (NUS), where I am currently a Professor and Provost's Chair. I was also 
serving as the Director of Control, Intelligent Systems and Robotics Area, and the Head of 
Control Sciences Group, NUS Temasek Laboratories. Since August 2018, I have also been a 
professor in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, the Chinese University 
of Hong Kong. I was a Changjiang Guest Chair Professor at Nanjing University of Science and 
Technology, China, from 2010 to 2013. My current research interests are in robust control, 
systems theory, control applications, the development of UAV helicopter systems, and financial 
market modeling.
