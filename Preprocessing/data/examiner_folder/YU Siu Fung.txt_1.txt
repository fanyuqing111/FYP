Research Highlight 
  

-----
Previous studies in computer simulation of semiconductor lasers (1994 – 2003): 
         Developed 
computer 
simulators 
for 
optoelectronic 
devices 
including 
long-wavelength distributed feedback and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, 
modulators etc for telecommunication applications. 
         His work (i.e., IEEE JQE, 30, pp.1389-1395, 1994) had been adopted to develop 
laser simulator namely ‘LASER PLUS’ in Lucent Technologies Inc. USA to study 
the transient response of distributed feedback lasers. 
         He also contributed to the understanding on the modulation response of 
vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). His understanding and knowledge 
in VCSELs had been summarized in form of a text book. 
Previous studies in ultraviolet light-emitting devices and lasers using metal-oxide based 
nanomaterials (2001 – 2010): 
         Demonstrate the realization of high-efficiency light-emitting devices using 
nanostructured ZnO, ZnMgO, SnO2, InSnO2, AlN etc as the active media. 
         Fabrication of room-temperature ultraviolet lasers by using ZnO based materials. 
The problems of inefficiency confinement of light and carriers had been solved for 
the realization of world-first ZnO based random laser diodes. 
         His work in ZnO lasers has been highlighted in the 'Newsbreaks' of the February 
2004 issue (Vol. 40, No. 2) of Laser Focus World. 
         Again, his ZnO lasers work was reviewed by Laser Focus World on December 2008 
issue in the article ‘PHOTONIC FRONTIERS: SEMICONDUCTOR UV LASERS: 
Materials are a tough challenge for ultraviolet diode lasers’. 
         Nanyang Technological University recognized his contribution on the realization 
of ZnO based laser diodes and awarded him and his collaborator a Nanyang Award 
for Research & Innovation in 2006. 
Research activities in photonic devices (2010 – now): 
         His current research activities involved the design, analysis and realization of 
lasers, plasmonic waveguides, solar cells, etc using metal-oxide and carbon based 
nanowires and nano-dots materials. 
         He has developed computer simulators to study the optical properties 
of plasmonic waveguides and lasers. 
         He has contributed to the design and fabrication of narrow-beam high-power THz 
quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). As none of the currently available THz QCLs can 
achieve such a high quality beam control, our work published in 2013 APL was 
highlighted in the “research highlights” of the April 2013 issue of Nature Photonics. 
         He 
has 
demonstrated 
for 
the 
first 
time 
the 
lasing 
emission 
from 
carbon-nanodots dispersed in solvents. 
         He has realized ~300 nm emission from SnO2 nanodots which can be used to 
fabricate deep UV-photonics. 
         First demonstration of deep UV (~310 nm) upconversion nanoparticles laser under 
980 nm excitation. 

-----
Recent development of large equipment and facility for the Department and University (2011 – now): 
   Femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy for time-resolved probe of structural 
dynamics of organic and inorganic materials. 
       Integration of the near-field scanning optical microscope with the femtosecond 
pump-probe spectroscopy for the optical studies (Raman/ photoluminescence) of 
nanostructure materials. 
       Realization of sub-micron fluorescence imaging with wavelength from deep UV 
(200 nm) to visible and to infrared (2.5 mm) regimes. 
       Involved in the establishment of the first university cleanroom including class 100, 
1000 and 10,000 regions with total area of ~500 m2 for the nanomaterials fabrication 
and characterization.
